<h1 title="">THE ROPE OF GOLD</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><br />CHAPTER I
<br />THE DANGLING LADDER</h2>
<p>Night was settling down over the mountain
side. Already the valleys far below
were lost in darkness. The massive fortress
which the dwellers on the island of Haiti have
always called the Citadel hung like a mountain
cliff above a boy who, hot from climbing, had
thrown himself on a bed of moss at the foot of a
gnarled mahogany tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he exclaimed softly to himself.
&ldquo;Even three thousand feet above the sea here in
Haiti it&rsquo;s hot. Hot and dry. Fellow&rsquo;d think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>He broke short off to stare. A curious thing
was happening. Out from a small dark opening
some forty feet up the perpendicular wall of the
massive abandoned fortification, something quite
indistinct in the twilight had moved and was
creeping slowly down the moss-grown wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a snake,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;only, here in
Haiti, there are no snakes to speak of and certainly
not one as long as that. Only look! It&rsquo;s
down to the window below; a full twenty feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That window&mdash;&rdquo; He caught his breath, then
began to count. &ldquo;One, two, three, four,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the window of Curlie&rsquo;s &lsquo;laburatory&rsquo; as
he calls it. It&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s a plot! I should warn
him. It&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He half rose, preparatory to a race up the
mountain side. Then he settled back to his seat
on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t make it,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Ground&rsquo;s
too rough. Boulders there big as a house. Too
far around, take a full hour to come in from the
rear. By that time, if anything really serious is
to happen, it will be over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, if worst comes to worst,&mdash;&rdquo; He put
out his hand to grip a six foot bow. It was a
good yew bow. The arrows at his side were
tipped with triangles of steel sharp as razor
blades. Down here in Haiti he had used these
for hunting wild guinea hens and wild pigs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if worst comes to worst,&rdquo; he told himself,
settling back against the trunk of the tree, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
an easy shot. I wouldn&rsquo;t miss. And the person,
whoever it may be, would not go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You who have read our other book called
&ldquo;Johnny Longbow&rdquo; will know that his thoughts
were true when they assured him that he would
not miss; for Johnny Thompson, by long and
careful application to the task, had mastered the
difficult art of archery. And this boy, resting
here at the edge of a tropical forest in that mysterious
island of Haiti, was none other than your
old friend Johnny Thompson. How he came
here; what strange stroke of fate it was that
brought him into company with the slim and supple
young inventor, Curlie Carson, does not, for
the moment, matter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>For some time after that Johnny&rsquo;s mind was
busied with many thoughts. The thing that
dangled there from window to window, was, he
thought, a rope. Later he decided it must be a
ladder, a rope ladder of henequin. The natives
of Haiti are expert spinners and rope makers.
From the tough fibers of the henequin leaf they
twist the finest cord and stoutest rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why is he there? And how did he get
there?&rdquo; He was thinking of the mysterious
being whose invisible hand had let down the rope
ladder. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been about the place for five
days and have seen no one. It&rsquo;s been quiet here&mdash;too
quiet. Ghostlike. Fellow can hardly sleep
nights in such a monstrous bat roost with its hundred
years of mystery and tragedy hanging over
his head, and it so silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here,&rdquo; he told himself, flexing his arms
that they might be fit for any emergency, &ldquo;here
we come upon someone who apparently has evil
intentions against Curlie. Of course, it may be
only curiosity. And who wouldn&rsquo;t be curious?
Got me guessing. All that stuff&mdash;batteries, boxes,
canvas bound packages. Three donkey loads.
You&rsquo;d think he was setting up a high-power
wireless station. But he hasn&rsquo;t, as yet. Hasn&rsquo;t
even erected an aerial.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>Curlie <i>was</i> a queer chap, there was no getting
round that. Tall, slim, with mysterious gray-green
eyes and with no past he had thus far
cared to mention, he had come into Johnny&rsquo;s life
on the way down to Haiti from the States. From
that time until now, save for the hours Curlie
spent in the secret room he had rigged up in the
old fort, the two boys had been inseparable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may not have a past worth mentioning,&rdquo;
Johnny had often told himself. &ldquo;But he has a
splendid present and fine ideals for the future.
And that is all that counts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time, as twilight turned to darkness,
nothing further happened. Keeping his eye on
the dangling ladder, Johnny allowed his mind
to wander over the events that had led up to the
present dramatic moment.</p>
<p>The whole affair had begun way back in freshman
high school days. Johnny&rsquo;s science professor
had become, in a way, his pal. His natural
interest in all matters pertaining to science had
made him a leader in that field.</p>
<p>Then too, like Johnny, the Professor was fond
of travel. Together, at odd moments, they had
traversed all of the New World and much of the
Old. All of this, of course, on maps and charts.
But always, in the end, they came back to one
spot, the Island of Haiti.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; the Professor had said over and
over, &ldquo;that is the most interesting island in the
world, has the most absorbing history, and most
tempting mountain jungles. Johnny,&rdquo; he had
always pounded the table at this juncture, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
soon be sixty. Thirty-five years of teaching!
That&rsquo;s enough for any man. When I am sixty
we&rsquo;ll really go to Haiti!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So here they were. In the meantime Johnny
had done a little wandering on his own account,
but as soon as he heard that his beloved Professor
had gone to Haiti, he had followed.</p>
<p>He had found the Professor head over heels in
work. For more than a hundred years this
strange republic, not Spanish, not French, nor
English, but pure native, red, black and brown,
had struggled along without aid from her sister
republic, Johnny&rsquo;s own beloved land. But now
the United States had taken a hand and Professor
Star had been given a share in the work. A
splendid, kind-hearted humanitarian, he had accepted
the challenge and, with no pay save his
living expenses, had assumed responsibility for
the comfort, happiness and well-being of more
than ten thousand natives.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big task,&rdquo; he told Johnny. &ldquo;An almost
impossible task without money. See that mason-work?&rdquo;
he had said one day as they walked
through a tangled mass of vines and bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Johnny had asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old French aqueduct, Johnny!&rdquo; He had
gripped the boy&rsquo;s arm hard. &ldquo;This narrow valley
was once one of the richest in the world. Irrigated
it was, by water from the mountain
streams. And, Johnny, if we had money for
cement, we&rsquo;d rebuild that aqueduct and these
half-starved and half-naked people would be
happy and prosperous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we, Johnny, you and I,&rdquo; his eyes had
shone with high hope. &ldquo;We would become rich,
for more than half of the land is uninhabited
waste that can be bought for an incredibly small
sum. And with water for irrigation it can be
reclaimed and sold&mdash;for who knows how much?
Get an American planter interested in it. Then
see! We&rsquo;d be rich, my boy! Think of an old
professor and a boy getting rich!&rdquo; He had
laughed a cackling sort of laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>But Johnny knew that he had meant what he
said, every word of it. And he was for it from
the start. But where was the money for repairing
the aqueduct? That was the rub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All we need,&rdquo; Johnny had smiled back, &ldquo;is
to find the &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; the old Professor had spoken again,
his voice grown husky, &ldquo;sometimes when one sees
the need, he is tempted to believe in fables, even
in pots of gold at the foot of the rainbow. Do
you see that massive pile of stone way up yonder,
built by the only real emperor the island ever
knew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny had looked away at the distant Citadel,
the massive fortress which was so near now,
down whose side the rope ladder dangled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; the Professor had grown quite excited,
&ldquo;this emperor of theirs, Christophe, was
apprenticed as a boy to a stone mason. They
say that as an old man, and a very rich emperor,
who owned a third of the plantations, he went
many times to work alone on those walls at night.
And they say that he built boxes and boxes of
gold into the twenty foot walls, together with
mortar and stone. Men often have dug for it,
but they never found the place. Possibly,&rdquo; he
had ended rather wearily, &ldquo;there was no gold.
But there should be. We need it. Christophe,
when at his best, had wonderful dreams regarding
the future of his people. Those people need
the gold as never before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; Johnny now thought to himself as
he looked away at the massive wall where the
rope ladder still dangled and where a pale light
gleamed from the lower window, &ldquo;I wonder
how much of that ancient tale was true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he looked up and up until his eye reached
the very crest of the crumbling fortress, he fancied
he saw a figure moving there. It suggested
the ghost of the emperor still laying stones in
the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that,&rdquo; he told himself stoutly, &ldquo;is pure
fancy. So, too, are the tales the natives tell of
the ghost emperor who returns from time to time
to work once more at night repairing the walls
to hide his treasure. I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>He broke short off. A dark figure had appeared
at the upper opening from which the rope
ladder dangled.</p>
<p>One breathless moment, as if looking for some
movement far or near, listening for a sound, the
figure of a native huddled there on the giant window
ledge.</p>
<p>It was strange, Johnny thought. Crouching
there in the shadow, one hand on the muzzle of
a century old brass cannon that had once barked
its defiance to the world, this native seemed a
spirit come from out the past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not that,&rdquo; the boy told himself. &ldquo;But
who is he? When did he come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had been at the ancient fortress. He
and Curlie Carson had been prowling about its
dungeons and secret passages for four days and
had not so much as seen a sign of a living human
being. The silence they had found oppressive
by day and spooky by night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And here is a man. I wonder&mdash;&rdquo; His wonderings
came to a sudden end. A strange
phenomena had broken in upon them. Just as
the native, having cast fears aside, had swung
out upon the slender rope ladder, one of those
curious after-glows of a sunset drenched the
Citadel with golden light.</p>
<p>The effect was magical. &ldquo;As if it came from
Arabian Nights,&rdquo; Johnny told himself, thrilled
to the very center of his being. The figure of the
native, quite naked save for a loin cloth, was
transformed into a bronze statue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the ladder seems our &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo;,&rdquo;
Johnny breathed.</p>
<p>The after-glow endured through a space of
ten seconds. Then all was dark as before. It
lasted long enough for the boy to see that a machete,
a great, long-bladed knife, hung at the
native&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Curlie is alone, unsuspecting,&rdquo; he told
himself, and a chill ran up his spine.</p>
<p>At once his mind was in a whirl. Should he
shout, warning his pal and perhaps frightening
the native away?</p>
<p>This, he thought, might be wise. Yet, nothing
serious might be contemplated. Most natives
wore machetes at their sides. Besides, there was
his own bow and arrow, a very useful weapon.
An arrow shattered against the wall would serve
to drive the intruder away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And if worst comes to worst&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gripped his bow, nocked an arrow, then
sat there breathless, waiting.</p>
<p>The thing that happened in the next sixty
seconds was surprising and dramatic.</p>
<p>With astonishing speed the native glided down
the ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s there! He&mdash;he&rsquo;s looking in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gripping his bow hard, Johnny took a long
breath. He felt that the time had come for sending
the arrow of warning. And yet&mdash;he wanted
to know more. So he waited. The bronze figure,
faintly illumined by the pale light from within,
hung there for a few moments, motionless.</p>
<p>Then with the speed of thought, things happened.
From within there came a sudden flash
of blinding red light. The next instant the wall
was a blank of darkness.</p>
<p>The whole thing was over in a space of time
not measured by seconds, yet Johnny had seen
it all. The native, his eyes distorted by fright,
had leaped backward and down. Turning a
complete somersault, he had gone speeding to
earth, twenty feet below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be killed!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed aloud.</p>
<p>But no. The space at the foot of the wall was
clear of brush. The next moment he saw the
man plainly. He went skulking along the wall
to at last lose himself in the shadows of some
ancient palm trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen the last of him,&rdquo; Johnny told
himself as he rose to take a long breath. &ldquo;I must
be getting back to camp. Dorn and old Pompee
will think something has happened to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he made his way rapidly over a narrow
path, down a slope and up the other side, then
through a dark and tangled forest, his thoughts
were busy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big piece of nonsense, this search for the
&lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo;,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;May never
have existed. Anyway, we&rsquo;ll never find it.
Fascinating though, and lots of fun, this search;
and life can&rsquo;t be all work.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>They <i>had</i> worked, he and Curlie Carson. For
two months, under the Professor&rsquo;s direction, they
had taught native children the simplest rudiments
of learning, had assisted native planters
at their work and had taught them new methods
of tilling the soil.</p>
<p>It had been a short summer and now, only a
few days more and he, Johnny, hoped to be going
back to the States. And Curlie Carson, the
strange lad with the wanderlust and a bent for
inventions, would go elsewhere too.</p>
<p>They had heard many times of the &lsquo;Rope of
Gold&rsquo;; a very fancy rope it had been, hand-wrought
with flowers of white gold and leaves of
green gold woven through it, so the story ran.</p>
<p>When the native emperor, the magnificent
Christophe, was at the height of his power, this
rope of gold had been strung through loops of
silver all the way down the sides of the massive
steps that led up to his palace. A hundred feet
long it was. When rolled up it required two men
to carry it. When revolution threatened, so the
story ran, the emperor had hidden the rope away
in the Citadel and there it remained to this day.
But where?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>This was the question the two boys had tried to
solve. Thus far they had made no headway.
The ancient walls, the dungeons, and secret passages
had yielded nothing more valuable than
dust, bats, rats and general decay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something one&rsquo;s not likely soon to forget,&rdquo;
the boy told himself.</p>
<p>He fell to musing on the life of that native
emperor and the fortification he had built.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thought the French would come back,&rdquo;
the Professor had said to him one day. &ldquo;He had
great dreams for the progress of his people. You
can hardly blame him for wanting to defend
them. In the end he forgot his great dreams for
his people and began worshipping gold and that
immense pile of brick and stone. Had he put
his trust in God instead of in power and gold,&rdquo;
the kindly old professor had rumbled on, &ldquo;had
he written his name on the hearts of men, his
name would have lived forever. Now there is
only that crumbling pile of masonry to remind
the world that he lived at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very strange,&rdquo; Johnny thought. &ldquo;If
one could but have lived then. If he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>He stopped short in his tracks. His eye had
caught sight of something unusual, a white thing
hanging from the lower branch of a large tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t have been here when I came along
an hour ago.&rdquo; His curiosity increased. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have
noticed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took two steps forward, then put out a hand
to touch it. The thing gave forth a hollow sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How queer!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;A native drum,
hanging here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without thinking much about what he was
doing, he took down the drum, which was a three
foot section of a hollowed-out log with a goat
skin strung across one end, placed it between his
knees and gave it two quick, sharp blows with
his hand.</p>
<p>The result was two resounding roars that set
the hills echoing.</p>
<p>The next instant, quite without warning, the
boy was seized and thrown violently to the
ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br />CHAPTER II
<br />THE NATIVE DRUM</h2>
<p>Johnny Thompson was no weakling.
He was a football player and a lightweight
boxer of no mean ability. He had lived clean and
taken good care of the physical side of his being
as every boy should. When the unseen person
seized him so suddenly from behind he was down
but not out by any manner of means. With a
deft twist he freed himself from the grasp of his
unknown adversary, and, leaping to his feet,
struck out with his right and left with the best
of results. His clenched fists landed with dull
thwacks. There followed the sound of a heavy
body staggering backward into the brush.</p>
<p>Having no desire to do bodily injury to anyone,
the boy turned and would have dashed
swiftly away had not a dark arm reached out to
entwine itself about his neck. This startling embrace
was followed by a blow on the head, which
left him all but senseless and without further
power of resistance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Sinking to the ground he awaited the end. To
his great surprise, he discovered that the end of
this particular adventure had already come. He
was left there alone in the dark.</p>
<p>Night, jungle night, dark, damp and silent
lay all about him. Still but half conscious of
what went on about him, not daring to move, he
lay there quite motionless.</p>
<p>A moment passed, another and yet another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no&mdash;no one about,&rdquo; he told himself
at last.</p>
<p>At that, there sounded off in the distance the
boom of a native drum; one stroke, that was all,
then again jungle silence hung over all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are a long way off. I must get&mdash;get
back to camp,&rdquo; he told himself as in a dream.
&ldquo;Dorn and old Pompee will go out hunting for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>He tried to rise. In this he failed. His head
whirled. He sank back and must have lost consciousness
for when next his benumbed brain
registered a thought, the light of a torch was
shining in his eyes and a face was before him.
A strange and very curious pair of eyes were
looking into his own.</p>
<p>The man was incredibly short and broad. He
seemed to have scarcely any legs at all. His face
was thin, his nose sharp and very crooked. But
his eyes! Johnny thought he had never looked
into a keener pair of eyes. To Johnny&rsquo;s great
surprise, he found that his bruised head had been
quite deftly bandaged. There was a pungent
odor of drugs about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They hit you,&rdquo; the short, broad, little man
said in quite a matter-of-fact tone. &ldquo;Hit you on
the head. Good thing I happened along. Gone
bad with you. But you&rsquo;re safe enough now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny looked into the man&rsquo;s eyes again and
wondered who he might be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the drum,&rdquo; the strange man went on.
&ldquo;You thumped it, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never thump a native drum here in Haiti.
Gets you in trouble, right away. If the Marines
or native police don&rsquo;t get you, someone else will.
Where&rsquo;d you get the drum, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was hanging on a tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh huh! They left it there. Notice how it
was made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut right out of a log, pretty hard log.
Plenty of work to make a native drum. Besides,
the natives love their drums. I can&rsquo;t say the
drums are a good thing. Lot of superstition and
wild practices hanging about them. But you
can&rsquo;t change people all at once. New ideas will
come, the right sort I mean, even here in Haiti.
But it takes time. Haiti&rsquo;s been practically
ignored by our country for a hundred years.
Now we&rsquo;re taking hold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know what would have happened to the drum
if the native police had got it?&rdquo; he asked, suddenly
fixing his sharp eyes on the boy. &ldquo;Burst
in its head,&rdquo; he continued, answering his own
question. &ldquo;Split it up for kindling wood. That&rsquo;s
what they&rsquo;d have done. The Marines would
have done the same. You&rsquo;re white like the Marines.
Probably these natives thought you meant
to burst their drum. That&rsquo;s why they treated
you rough. But you&rsquo;ll be right enough now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Th&mdash;thanks. I&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny did not finish.
The strange short, broad man had vanished into
the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; Johnny told himself, rising stiffly, &ldquo;is
the strangest island I have ever known. You
strike a drum on the head and get struck on the
head in return. A short, broad, white man, with
the skill of a surgeon, comes along and fixes you
up. Who hit me? Who is this curious doctor-like
man? Where&rsquo;d he come from? What&rsquo;s he
doing down here? Guess I&rsquo;d better hurry on
back to camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His steps were a trifle unsteady at first. His
head hurt. As his blood warmed, he got the
better of this and in due time walked into an
illuminated circle which was the light of his own
camp fire, to exclaim as he dropped down beside
three shadowy figures:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here I am and I&rsquo;ve had an adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adventure!&rdquo; The voice of the speaker was
shrill and high-pitched, the voice of a boy in his
early teens. &ldquo;Tell us about it.&rdquo; This boy was
Dorn Montcalm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>Dorn Montcalm was the son of a merchant
who made his home in one of the hill villages of
Haiti. His father, who had the good of the Island
natives at heart, had taken a great liking
to Johnny&rsquo;s aged Professor. They had exchanged
many visits. In this way Dorn had become
acquainted with Johnny. When he learned
of the proposed search for the &ldquo;Rope of Gold&rdquo;
he had begged to be allowed to go along. Permission
was granted by his father only on condition
that Pompee, a native servant and a very
giant of a man, be taken along as his bodyguard.
Pompee was more than welcome for, besides being
a man of great physical prowess, he was a
famous cook. He knew the value of every native
herb, root and fruit. When occasion demanded,
he could gather and prepare a delicious repast in
the heart of the jungle.</p>
<p>So they sat there by the camp fire waiting for
Johnny&rsquo;s story, Curlie Carson, Dorn and Pompee.
The shadow and the spell of the Citadel
was upon them. For some time Johnny did not
speak. Their temporary abode, a dark man-made
chasm, part of the Citadel, yawned at their
back; on either side rose the massive walls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened to your head?&rdquo; demanded
Curlie, suddenly catching sight of Johnny&rsquo;s
white bandages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to that presently,&rdquo; replied Johnny.
&ldquo;Had a visitor to-night, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Why of course not!&rdquo; Curlie seemed
quite startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looked in at your window.&rdquo; Johnny
chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Curlie laughed out loud. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
twenty feet from the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you didn&rsquo;t see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. There was no one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was,&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s tone was serious.</p>
<p>Curlie Carson leaped to his feet. &ldquo;What!
How&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hung a rope ladder to the great brass cannon
above,&rdquo; Johnny said quietly. &ldquo;He climbed
down after a while. And after that, quite soon,
he saw something that caused him to do a back
somersault off the end of his ladder. Wonder
he didn&rsquo;t break his neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; said Curlie, pacing nervously
back and forth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;Apparently these natives
are like cats&mdash;always land on their feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was surprised at the evident agitation
caused in Curlie&rsquo;s mind by this disclosure.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he cooking up in that dark little laboratory
of his?&rdquo; Johnny asked himself. He recalled
the mysterious packages Curlie&rsquo;s burros
had packed up the mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Radio is all I can think of,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;Lots of sense to that. We had a portable outfit
complete in a box and decided not to bring it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was to know the answer to all this in due
time. For the present it was to remain the freshest
mystery of the grim old Citadel.</p>
<p>Presently Curlie dropped back to his place beside
the fire, which by this time had burned itself
down to a dark red bed of blackening coals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all done by the aid of batteries,&rdquo; he mumbled
as if speaking to himself. &ldquo;Did that visitor
of mine come round and try to break your head?&rdquo;
he asked, once more staring at Johnny&rsquo;s bandages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, well,&mdash;perhaps, who can tell? It was
some native or other.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>Settling back in his place Johnny told of the
night&rsquo;s encounter. &ldquo;That proves,&rdquo; he ended,
&ldquo;that some places are not as safe as they seem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that you may expect a doctor to appear
upon the scene at any time,&rdquo; laughed Curlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; said Johnny quite soberly, &ldquo;he
was a handy person to meet. Only hope I get an
opportunity to repay him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more silence, the great, ominous, silence
of the Citadel hung over all. For a full ten
minutes no one spoke. It was old Pompee who
at last broke the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once,&rdquo; his deep voice rumbled, &ldquo;men lay upon
the ground as we rest here now, waiting for
sleep to come. There were hundreds, perhaps
thousands of them, prisoners condemned to toil
upon the unfinished walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And on this night,&rdquo; his voice rolled deep, and
solemn, &ldquo;as they looked up they saw a single
man toiling there, as they had toiled during the
day. This man was larger than any one of us,
larger than any of them. And he was greater
than all of them,&rdquo; Pompee continued. &ldquo;The
greatest, most powerful ruler Haiti has ever
known. He was their emperor. And yet he
toiled there at common labor the long night
through. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>As he paused for an answer he looked away at
the distant wall to fancy again that he saw a
figure moving there, to imagine that he caught
the rhythmic motion of a mason working in
brick, mortar and stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he went on as no one spoke, &ldquo;he
may have been angry and impatient at the
slow workmen. And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hid something there,&rdquo; said Dorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that?&rdquo; asked Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Dorn. &ldquo;It
required two men to carry it. But the emperor
was a powerful man, the most powerful ever
known in Haiti.&rdquo; The French boy&rsquo;s tone became
eager, insistent. &ldquo;He could have wrapped it
about him, inside his great purple coat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Pompee, giving approval. &ldquo;And
that is what he did. But where is the &lsquo;Rope of
Gold&rsquo; now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this question none could give answer,
though each wished that he could do so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>Once more the silence of shadows and night
fell upon them.</p>
<p>For some time Curlie spread his slim legs before
the fire. Then, apparently remembering
some forgotten mission, he sprang to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going down the mountain,&rdquo; he said shortly.
&ldquo;Be late getting back, past midnight probably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out for the natives,&rdquo; warned Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Natives?&rdquo; said Curlie. &ldquo;Natives of Haiti?
They wouldn&rsquo;t hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never can tell.&rdquo; Johnny rubbed his
bandaged head.</p>
<p>Curlie disappeared. The fire burned lower
and lower till only a spark remained. Then, because
their musty bedchamber within the grim
walls seemed unusually damp and chill on this
night, Johnny and Dorn dragged their blankets
to a flat open space. There rolling themselves
up side by side, with the massive Pompee near by,
they prepared for sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>Dorn, the dark-eyed French boy, was soon
breathing in the steady way of a deep sleeper.
But Johnny could not sleep. Life that day had
been strange. He had thought little of this journey
in the beginning. True, he had hoped, boy
fashion, that something might come of it; that
they might find something of real value that
would aid the aged Professor in his work. It
was to be, at worst, a well deserved vacation, a
week&rsquo;s experience worth telling of when he returned
to his home in the States.</p>
<p>But the presence of natives where there had
been no natives before, especially of a long-haired
bronze type such as he had not seen before,
was vaguely disturbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like coming quite suddenly upon a bumblebee&rsquo;s
nest,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;only a great deal
worse. What can they want? Is there really
something hidden here that they know of and
do not wish disturbed? What will come of it
all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finding that sleep would not come, he rose at
last to begin the ascent of a flight of stairs leading
to the top of the Citadel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go a little way up,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Cool
my blood. Dorn&rsquo;s safe enough. There&rsquo;s Pompee
to protect him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>As he began to climb, the bracing night air,
acting as a stimulant, drove him up and up until
at last he stood at the very top of the Citadel, one
hundred and thirty feet above the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he told himself with a quick intake of
breath, &ldquo;Christophe the Emperor stood on that
memorable night spreading mortar and laying
bricks. And it may be,&rdquo; he caught his breath,
&ldquo;that I am standing at this very moment above
the treasure he buried so long ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Christophe!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;In your
younger days, before the love of gold and power
drove you mad, you dreamed great dreams for
the good of your people. Now, as never before,
they need the wealth you hid away in your time
of great might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would have added, &ldquo;If it be within your
power reveal the hiding place to me now,&rdquo; but
somehow a feeling came over him that this would
be akin to the wild superstitions that pervaded
the land, so he fell into silence.</p>
<p>The top of the Citadel is broad and very long;
a perfect promenade for a moonlight night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>Now fancying himself a guard pacing his beat
in the silent night, and now endeavoring to live
again the days of long ago, Johnny paced the
ramparts in silence.</p>
<p>Never had there been such a night, and never
a lovelier sight in all the world. At the back of
the Citadel distant mountains loomed, blue, indistinct,
mysterious.</p>
<p>Before him he caught the glint of the far away
sea. At its shore, he knew, palms grew rank and
tall, shading beautiful white stucco homes. The
water of the sea was blue and clear as the most
transparent glass. Green parrots flitted from
tree to tree. And in the evening the mocking
birds sing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most beautiful island in all the
world,&rdquo; he told himself, as he walked slowly
along with bowed head, &ldquo;and yet its history is
the saddest of all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Columbus found it. He made an earnest attempt
to colonize it. Yet it brought him only
sorrow, a dungeon and chains. The French conquered
it. It brought them only death. Christophe
dreamed dreams. He, too, ended in
defeat. And why? Gold! Columbus might
have succeeded but the greedy Spaniards demanded
gold and more gold. He was obliged to
enslave the natives to obtain gold. The French
were no better. Slavery has always brought
tragedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold. Christophe was thought of as a hero
and a liberator until he fell in love with glittering
gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold,&rdquo; he stopped short in his tracks. He
was here at this very moment in a search for
gold, the &lsquo;Rope of Gold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; he told himself after a moment&rsquo;s
thought. &ldquo;But we want it at least in part for
others, not entirely for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He strolled slowly on. As he did so, he saw
in his mind&rsquo;s eye a broad aqueduct running
down from the mountain and on out over a desolate,
cactus grown plain. It was broken in places,
but once it was repaired it would bring water to
thousands of thirsty acres. Not alone that, but
it would bring pure, cold water to those who now
traveled far to carry luke-warm water on donkeys&rsquo;
backs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hundreds die needlessly every year because
of the water,&rdquo; the Professor had said. &ldquo;If only
we had the money for rebuilding the waste
places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have it,&rdquo; the boy told himself.
&ldquo;Somehow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of a sudden, he felt himself sinking. His
first thought was that he had walked off the wall.</p>
<p>But no, he was in the very center.</p>
<p>Stones crumbled and glided beneath his feet.
He threw his arms out madly. It was no use.
Down, down he went.</p>
<p>He knew on the instant that the unusual had
happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a secret opening in the wall,&rdquo; he told
himself. &ldquo;I have found the hiding place of the
&lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or you have found death,&rdquo; a voice seemed to
whisper. &ldquo;You are more than a hundred feet
above the mountain top.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER III
<br />THE HIDDEN PITFALL</h2>
<p>Not once in all his young life had Johnny
Thompson felt so near his end as when he
felt himself shooting downward into the unknown
heart of the ancient Citadel.</p>
<p>That there were cavities, cisterns, secret passages,
and air-vents running here and there
through that massive pile of stone, he knew well
enough. Some of them he and Curlie, ever hopeful
of finding the hidden treasure, had explored.
Some cavities had been prisons, others granaries,
and one vastly greater than all others had been
a cistern for storing rain water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this one?&rdquo; His heart stopped beating.
What if it were an air shaft, running to the very
bottom, a hundred feet below? He dared not
think. What if it were indeed a storage place
for treasure? What if he landed on piles of
clinking gold? He dared not hope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>At this moment life, the priceless gift, seemed
more precious than ever before. The affair was
over in a fraction of a second, yet in that brief
span of time all the bright glory of life in this
beautiful world appeared to flash before him.</p>
<p>Thud! He struck with a sudden force that
drove his knees into his chin and set his teeth
rattling.</p>
<p>Instantly there was the sound of wild commotion
all about him. &ldquo;Bats!&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;Wait till I get out my flashlight. They&rsquo;ll
scurry away fast enough. Only hope the torch
is not broken in the fall. Whew! How glad I
am to be alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was with trembling fingers that he at last
drew the small flashlight from his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the bulb&rsquo;s broken,&rdquo; he thought as a cold
chill set his teeth chattering. &ldquo;Not much fun
spending the night down here with these bats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little cry of joy escaped his lips as the light
flashed on and the bats, as if touched by a magician&rsquo;s
wand, vanished from sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>His joy was short lived. The place he was in
was small, not over fifteen feet from corner to
corner. And the walls that towered above him,
some twenty feet, instead of running straight up,
slanted in from bottom to top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if I had been sitting upon the very tip-top
of a twenty foot pyramid,&rdquo; he told himself,
&ldquo;and the tip crumbled in, letting me drop inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish it was made of paste-board,&rdquo; he told
himself, tapping the solid stone wall. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s
not, and I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down to think. Here indeed was a
predicament. Neither Curlie nor Dorn knew
where he had gone. He would not be able to get
out by himself. When he did not return they
would search for him. But in that vast pile of
brick and stone what chance was there of being
found? In its day it had been the most massive
fort in the western hemisphere. Ten thousand
troops had been quartered there. There were
hundreds of holes and caverns, dungeons and
passages to be searched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there is the jungle all about,&rdquo; he told
himself. &ldquo;They may think I have been kidnapped
by natives and may go searching there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>But Johnny was young. What was still better,
he had a firm faith in the ways of Providence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will hear them walking on the wall,&rdquo; he
told himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did hear someone walking on the wall and
did call. The result, however, was far different
from what he expected.</p>
<p>In the meantime Curlie Carson was returning
over a jungle path in the night. The objects he
carried slung over his back would have caused
Johnny Thompson to stare in amazement. They
were two native drums. One was small but the
other was an exact duplicate of the one that had
won for Johnny a sore head and had endangered
his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all done with the aid of batteries,&rdquo; Curlie
repeated to himself as he passed from a moonlit
spot into the shadows. &ldquo;But the drums will help.
They will help a lot.&rdquo; He let forth a low deep
chuckle that said volumes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t Johnny and Dorn be surprised!&rdquo; He
chuckled again.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>After stirring uneasily in his blankets, Dorn
at last awoke. It was late in the night, he knew,
because the moon was hanging low. He put out
a hand to the spot where Johnny should have
been sleeping. It was empty. He was a little
startled at this. He was more surprised and disturbed
a moment later as a dull tum-tum came
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Native drums,&rdquo; he whispered to himself.
Yet he could not be sure.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the sound appeared to come
from within the fort itself, in the direction of
Curlie&rsquo;s improvised laboratory.</p>
<p>As the boy propped himself up for a look at
the fort, he fancied he caught a flash of red light.
Yes, there it was again, this time it was yellow.
It appeared to come from a great crack in the
wall. This crack, he suddenly recalled, ran a
zig-zagging course down the right side of Curlie&rsquo;s
laboratory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange he&rsquo;d work so late,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>Then of a sudden, this time louder, more distinct,
came the boom of a drum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>He was startled. Recalling Johnny&rsquo;s story of
the spying native, he wondered if some wandering
tribe of wild natives had taken possession of
Curlie&rsquo;s secret place. He thought of waking
Pompee. Then, of a sudden his heart went cold.
What if Pompee too were gone?</p>
<p>A moment of suspense and he was reassured.
Pompee&rsquo;s great bulk, sprawled out before the
fire, was unmistakable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all so strange,&rdquo; he told himself, dropping
back into his place. &ldquo;I&mdash;I almost wish I hadn&rsquo;t
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, like Johnny, he saw in his mind&rsquo;s eye
the needy natives, the children, bright-eyed boys
and girls stricken with sickness from bad water
and pining away without hope. Then, because
he was very young and eager, his vision returned
brighter than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;We
will find it, perhaps to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later Curlie Carson came
tiptoeing silently through the shadows. He
paused for a moment to look down at the sleepers,
gave vent to a low whistle of surprise upon seeing
that Johnny was gone, then stood for a moment
as if in deep thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Johnny?&rdquo; asked Dorn, sitting up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; Curlie&rsquo;s voice showed
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the boy replied. &ldquo;He was here. I fell
asleep. I woke up. He was gone. That is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Curlie, dropping to a
place beside Dorn and drawing a blanket about
him. &ldquo;Gone for a walk. Be coming back presently.
Anyway, we couldn&rsquo;t find him in the
night if we tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Realizing the truth of this, Dorn settled back
in his place to at last fall asleep.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>In his accidental prison Johnny Thompson
found only one task before him, with plenty of
time for its execution. This task was that of examining
every niche and cranny of the enclosure
which might lead to a means of escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; he exclaimed at last. &ldquo;One
might, perhaps, climb a perpendicular wall.
Jean Val Jean in Victor Hugo&rsquo;s book was
credited with that power. But when the walls
slant toward you on every side, what chance?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>Once more he sat down. And, because he
wished to conserve his meager supply of light, he
snapped off the electric torch to sit staring into
utter darkness.</p>
<p>What does one think of when he is at the
bottom of a dungeon in a strange land? Johnny
wondered a while about this. That he was not
the first one who had spent hours of solitary
darkness in this great fortress he knew well
enough. He was not even the first white man.
During the reign of Christophe more than one
daring soldier of fortune sought adventure in
Haiti to find a dungeon instead.</p>
<p>With much time on his hands, Johnny thought
of many things. He thought first of the aged
Professor and his labor of love for the kindly
natives of the valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to help.&rdquo; His throat tightened.
&ldquo;The Professor laughed at our search. He said
there was no &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo;. Perhaps he was
right. But it was a beautiful dream. Besides,
he said it would be a fine experience. Well,&rdquo; he
sighed, &ldquo;it <i>is</i> an experience.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>For a long time he sat there thinking and the
thoughts that came to him were far from happy
ones. Then, into his consciousness there came a
disturbance. He scarcely knew its cause. Was
it a sound? Was it some slight movement close
at hand? His hair appeared to rise as he sat
there straining in a vain effort to sense the thing
that crept in upon him.</p>
<p>In an effort to think clearly, he rested his head
back against the wall. Then, like a flash it came
to him. Someone was walking up above, yet so
soft were the foot-falls that it was necessary for
him to sense the jar of them by placing his head
against the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be Curlie,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Nor
Dorn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because of the sharp cactus that grew among
the rocks the boys wore heavy soled, high-topped
boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s someone,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;And
that someone must help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once two pictures flashed into his mind:
one of a strange native clinging to a slender rope
ladder, peering into Curlie&rsquo;s laboratory; the
other of a curious, broad, little white man looking
down at him through thick glasses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What if it&rsquo;s the native!&rdquo; he thought with a
shudder. &ldquo;What if he has companions and this
is a trap, a pitfall prepared for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated. The thing seemed absurd. Yet
there had always been strange doings at the
Citadel. For ten years after the emperor&rsquo;s death
the Citadel had been closely guarded. No one
might enter it save with one hand in that of the
escorting guard.</p>
<p>Even of late, attempts to explore the walls had
been frustrated. A party with picks and shovels
had come here. In the morning their tools had
vanished. A single white man had camped here.
Some time later his camp was found deserted
and partially destroyed. He had never been seen
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; the boy grunted, shaking himself free
from these forebodings. &ldquo;He may have perished
by falling into a hole, as I will if I do not make
the most of any opportunity to escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that, throwing caution to the wind, he
stood on tiptoe and cupping his hands shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello there! Hello! Hello!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ancient walls roared back <i>Hello</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Almost instantly the jar of footsteps grew
more distinct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got me the first time.&rdquo; A thrill of real joy
shot through his being. This was followed almost
instantly by a great wave of fear. Who
was walking up there at the small hours of the
night? What was to come of it all?</p>
<p>The first question was answered immediately.
Hearing a stir at the top he threw on his flashlight
to find himself staring into a familiar face,
the face of the native who, but a few hours before,
had been swinging on the rope ladder before
Curlie&rsquo;s window.</p>
<p>If any doubt remained in his mind, it was dispelled
at once, for without uttering a word, the
native began letting down the rope ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all the world as if it had been prepared
for this very occasion.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s heart raced.
His brow grew hot, then turned icy cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;the die is cast. There&rsquo;s
nothing now but to climb the ladder.&rdquo; With
that he awaited its coming.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER IV
<br />HE WHO WALKS ALONE</h2>
<p>Dorn, the young French boy, awoke early
on the morning after Johnny&rsquo;s disappearance.
He had fallen asleep in the middle of the
night confident that he would find his good
American friend sleeping peacefully by his side
in the morning. That he was not there alarmed
him.</p>
<p>Like most French boys of the better class,
Dorn was endowed with a sense of responsibility
beyond his years. He awakened Pompee and
Curlie Carson and was for starting a search at
once, even without breakfast.</p>
<p>This plan Curlie vetoed. He had been out
prowling around late at night and was hungry.
Besides, being something of a soldier of fortune,
who had been lost many times himself, he did
not share the French boy&rsquo;s apprehension.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll show up,&rdquo; he said, digging in his pack
for a match to light the fire. &ldquo;Pompee won&rsquo;t be
any good without his morning cup of coffee; for
that matter, neither will I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour later, having eaten a hasty breakfast
of cassava bread, coffee and mangoes, Dorn
struck away across the court that led to the main
stairway of the Citadel.</p>
<p>His heart was heavy for he had taken a great
liking to the frank, free and kindly American
boy, Johnny Thompson. He knew, too, what a
dangerous thing it is to be lost in a jungle.</p>
<p>With his eyes and ears open, he wandered
among the ruins. Up a stair here, down one
there, peering here, there, everywhere he went.
Always hoping to catch sight of Johnny&rsquo;s sturdy
figure yet always disappointed, he spent the
whole bright tropical morning hunting.</p>
<p>At times he came upon Curlie Carson or Pompee.
They, too, were searching. Curlie was taking
the affair seriously at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t find him trapped somewhere in
the Citadel,&rdquo; he said to Dorn, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to take
to the jungle trails. He may have been spirited
away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Spirited away?&rdquo; The French boy&rsquo;s tone
showed surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, by the natives. There&rsquo;s been a lot of
queer doings around this mossy old pile of stone.
Remember that native who took the trouble to
hang a ladder before my window and look in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t do that just for fun. These natives
are serious folks, despite all their drumming,
dancing and singing. I&rsquo;ve seen natives of other
lands, Central America, Alaska, Siberia. I tell
you they&rsquo;re different.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re superstitious, too,&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;Look at the way I frightened that fellow,&rdquo; he
laughed. &ldquo;Never meant to at all. Didn&rsquo;t even
know he was there. But look! A little flash of
red light, a little something for him to see and
Bim! Down he goes, head over heels. Wonder
he didn&rsquo;t break his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know what, Dorn?&rdquo; he suddenly grew serious.
&ldquo;Know what I could do? I could walk
from one end of this island to the other and take
you with me, and you&rsquo;d never see a native; at
night I mean, always at night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But there are thousands of homes right by
the roadside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of homes. Homes can&rsquo;t run away.
People can. You might see their bare heels.
That would be all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Pompee who made the discovery of the
day. There were many strange secrets hidden
away behind Pompee&rsquo;s wrinkled old brow. As
a boy he had wandered many days among these
ruins. Fear had been upon him then and a great
dread, a dread of the spirits of those who had
lived there in the past. Yet a boy&rsquo;s consuming
curiosity had led him on and on until he knew
every dungeon, every secret passage as an American
boy knows the secrets of the woods at the
back of his pasture.</p>
<p>While Curlie and Dorn searched every dark
corner, Pompee had eyes only for the new, the
unfamiliar. In time he found it, a fresh break
in the top of the Citadel.</p>
<p>There he dropped on hands and knees to shade
his aged eyes and peer into the darkness below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>Long he remained there motionless. Then of
a sudden, a low exclamation escaped his lips.
Having moved a little to one side, he had allowed
a glimmer of light to touch a spot on the
floor of that dark hole where Johnny had come
upon a misadventure.</p>
<p>Another moment of silence, then he spoke a
name:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke it so softly it could not have been
heard ten yards away.</p>
<p>He listened. No answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; a little louder this time. Still no
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny Thompson!&rdquo; His lips were at the
jagged opening now. His voice sounded out like
the roar of a great beast in the hollow enclosure.
A bat beat the air with its wings.</p>
<p>Still no answer.</p>
<p>The old man rose to his feet. On his face was
a look of fear, the fear that had gripped him here
as a boy. His voice trembled, his words came out
through chattering teeth as he called again and
again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dorn! Dorn! Dorn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this time there came an answering call.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>After a long day of weary search Dorn had
seated himself on a stone parapet to watch the
sun, a fiery red ball slowly sinking toward the
sea. As he sat there it seemed to him that the
sun of hope for a little valley that he and Johnny
and the Professor had learned to love, was sinking
never to rise with another morn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The valley has seen triumph and tragedy,&rdquo;
he told himself. &ldquo;Time was when one could not
have found a richer valley. And yet, even then
those who labored there were poor. They were
slaves. After that freedom and revolution, a
hundred years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now, how his hopes had grown. America,
the United States, great, strong, beautiful
America had come to the aid of little Haiti. Valleys
were blossoming as of old. Health was returning
to the people. And all this time they
were free. &ldquo;Free,&rdquo; he repeated the word
reverently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hoped so much for our little valley too,&rdquo;
he told himself. &ldquo;But there is not money for all.
Some must wait. And now,&rdquo; his throat tightened.
&ldquo;Johnny Thompson is lost, perhaps gone
forever. And our golden dream will soon be
forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>It was at this moment that he heard the call of
old Pompee. It was a strange call, he thought.
These Haitians express so much in a call. But
this call spoke neither of joy nor sorrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can it be?&rdquo; he asked himself as, springing
down from his seat, high above the mountain
crest, he went racing down at a reckless pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? Have you found him?&rdquo; he cried
as he came near.</p>
<p>Pompee did not answer. He merely stood and
pointed at his feet.</p>
<p>Only when the boy stood at his side did he see
that he was pointing at a hole in the Citadel&rsquo;s
stone top.</p>
<p>Dropping on one knee, he stared into the darkness
of that man-made cavern but could see nothing.
The sun had sunk too low. The spot of
light was no longer there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>Only by lighting a match and allowing it to
drop was he able to see. Then he gave forth a
sharp exclamation. What he saw was a khaki
handkerchief. The ownership of that bit of
cloth was unmistakable. A little friend of Johnny&rsquo;s
had embroidered a large red J in each of his
handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Johnny&rsquo;s!&rdquo; he said in a low, tense tone.
&ldquo;He has been down there. He&mdash;he fell in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pompee nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he down there still?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pompee shook his head solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where can he be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can one say? See!&rdquo; said the faithful
old servant. &ldquo;The sun is gone. Night comes
swiftly. Caught on the top of this place where
spirits walk, who can say what may happen to
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spirits do no harm,&rdquo; said Dorn. &ldquo;It is only
the living ones. But we will go down.&rdquo; He led
the way.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>And what of Johnny? Where was he?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>He had accepted the proffered aid. He had
climbed the rope ladder. What else was there to
do? The native who looked down upon him, who
earlier in the night had looked in upon Curlie
Carson at his work, might be a villain. What
of it? If he had cared to he might have murdered
Johnny, then closed up the hole in the
fortress roof. That he had not chosen to do so
was in his favor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably an innocent, kindly fellow,&rdquo; Johnny
told himself. &ldquo;A little curious, that&rsquo;s all. Most
of the natives down here are like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not feel too certain that this conclusion
was correct. Nevertheless, up the rope ladder he
went. And as he climbed, all unbeknown to him,
his handkerchief fluttered from his pocket and
dropped to the floor, there to remain as mute evidence
that its owner had spent some time in that
dungeon-like hole. Hours later, as you have
seen, it was found by Pompee.</p>
<p>On clambering over the rough entrance to the
pitfall he found himself surrounded by three
stalwart brown men. These men were armed
only with steel pointed spears and machetes, a
thing Johnny marveled at. In the part of Haiti
which he had visited, spears were scarce, bows
and arrows practically unknown, and rifles very
common.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>As he thought this through he recalled his own
bow and quiver of arrows. He had taken them
with him on his lonely ramble; in fact he never
left camp without them.</p>
<p>In his fall the bow had been knocked from his
hand and the quiver, caught on a jagged bit of
rock, had broken the light thong that held it to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they now?&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>Ah, there they were!</p>
<p>With a sigh of relief he stooped to pick up his
bow. He was not interrupted in this procedure,
but as his right hand gripped the bow, one of the
natives seized the quiver of razor-pointed arrows.</p>
<p>A thrill shot through him. His brow grew
suddenly cold. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;At
least they don&rsquo;t trust me too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning about, the native who had seized the
quiver started away, over a dim trail that did
not lead toward the boy&rsquo;s camp.</p>
<p>For a moment the boy stood where he was.
Then a hand pushed him very gently forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;They are
three. I am one. It is night. I am unarmed.
Whatever they will to do they can do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>He thought of the young French boy.
&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t have brought him,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;But old Pompee will care for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought of the needy valley people, of the
old Professor and his dreams, of the &lsquo;Rope of
Gold&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the end of that,&rdquo; he told himself as
he followed on in the darkness.</p>
<p>They led him along the top of the Citadel for
a time, then, after descending stone stairways
into the heart of the fortress, lost him completely
in a maze of rooms and passageways to at last
emerge upon the top of a stairway that, hidden
as it was by great over-hanging treetops, had
escaped the eager eyes of the three boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They know a great deal about this old fortress,&rdquo;
Johnny told himself. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder
if they could lead me to the &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where do we go from here?&rdquo; he asked
himself, as the leader moved on down the moss-grown
stairs.</p>
<p>At the foot of the stairs were some twenty natives.
Apparently Johnny and his guards had
been expected. He noted with a little tremor
that two of the men carried light strong ropes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>Without a word the men formed in line, some
in front, some behind him. Then, slowly, the
procession moved forward single file over a narrow
trail Johnny had not known before.</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s head was in a whirl. They had not
said &ldquo;Come.&rdquo; They had not said, &ldquo;You must go
with us.&rdquo; They had said nothing. And yet,
there was a subtle something about their actions
that said plainer than words, &ldquo;It is useless to
resist. You must come with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where am I going?&rdquo; he asked himself.
&ldquo;Where will I be when I get there? And why
am I going at all?&rdquo; Since he could find no answer
to these questions, he gripped his stout bow
(now quite useless without his arrows) and
trudged silently on into the night.</p>
<p>Several hours later he found himself lying upon
his back beneath a giant mahogany tree. He
was far up the mountain side. Greenish-gray
moss hung like beards from the tree branches.
Here it was cool even in daytime.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>They had left the trail a half hour before,
he and the strange group of natives. He guessed
they were hiding until dark. When darkness
came they would travel again. Where would
they go? What was the end of the trail? To
these questions he could form no answer. He
had dined well enough on native food. He was
not being disturbed now; watched that was all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange business,&rdquo; he grumbled to himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER V
<br />THE GIANT ON THE WALL</h2>
<p>All that long, tropical day, with the sun
burning hot and dry upon him, Curlie Carson
had sought for some trace of Johnny Thompson.
At the time Pompee discovered the break
in the top of the fortress he was some distance
away from the Citadel.</p>
<p>Toward evening he had disappeared into the
brush. There, crouching low, like some great,
slim cat he prowled along bush grown, vine hung
trails looking for a familiar footprint.</p>
<p>Long after darkness had fallen, with the
golden spot of an electric torch ever moving before
him, he prowled on.</p>
<p>Here a surprised covey of wild parrots flew
screaming away, and there some strange creature
went scampering down his path. Here he narrowly
avoided stepping on a great lizard asleep
in the trail, and there a yellow snake with green
eyes that gleamed horribly in the night caused
him to start and shudder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>At last, at a place some five miles from the
Citadel, where two trails crossed at a sharp
angle, he came to an abrupt halt to bend down
and examine the loose, dry soil. Dropping on
hands and knees he followed the other trail for a
distance of fifty yards or more. Coming upon
the dry bed of a stream, he halted. There, to all
appearance, he found what he sought.</p>
<p>The bed of the stream was completely dry, but
up the bank a little way was a small damp spot,
where in the rainy season a spring flowed. In
this damp spot were three well marked footsteps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d
desert us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a full moment he stood there pondering.
Then at last he turned and walked back toward
camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t desert us. Stands to reason he
wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;He might have discovered
a clue. Some native might be leading
him on. But leading him on to what?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>Curlie didn&rsquo;t trust natives. He had a notion
that all people save those of his own race were
treacherous.</p>
<p>Arrived at camp, he cast down a bombshell by
saying in his quietest drawl:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny&rsquo;s gone into the mountains with a
bunch of natives. We&rsquo;ll follow in the morning,
and we&rsquo;ll take Mike with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorn, the French boy, wanted to ask who Mike
was, but being timid, and having always been
somewhat ill at ease in the presence of this peculiar
boy, he asked nothing.</p>
<p>Curlie ate hastily and in silence. Then with
a mumbled excuse, he lost himself once more in
the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange fellow,&rdquo; said Dorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day mebby <i>Papa Lou</i>,&rdquo; said old Pompee,
with a shake of his wise old head. &ldquo;Plenty
understand that one boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A <i>Papa Lou</i> is a native witch doctor of Haiti, a
priest of the Voodoo cult. Dorn thought it very
improbable that Curlie, or, for that matter, any
white boy, would turn into a <i>Papa Lou</i>. However,
realizing the futility of arguing with an old
man, he kept silent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>With his back against a tree, with the moon
gilding the topmost ridge of the ancient fortress,
the French boy sat wondering in a troubled sort
of way what had become of his good friend
Johnny Thompson. Beyond the discovery of the
khaki handkerchief at the bottom of the pitfall,
they had found no trace of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t have gone away of his own accord,&rdquo;
he assured himself. &ldquo;He is too honorable for
that. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His reflections were broken short off by the
cry of old Pompee:</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, <i>Monsieur</i>. Only look! Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorn did look and what he saw made his blood
run cold.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>What Dorn saw had nothing to do with
Johnny Thompson. For all that Johnny was
having his share of adventure. We left him, as
you will know, hiding away with his captors in
a secluded tropical glade. The day was hot. He
had traveled far. His day dreams may have
blended with real dreams. Be that as it may, he
was suddenly startled into complete consciousness
by a series of shrill cries and, as he sprang
to his feet, found himself in complete possession
of the field. Every black had fled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>Hearing a sound in a tree at his left, he turned
to see a native frantically struggling up the
trunk in an endeavor to reach the lowest branch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole bunch has gone mad,&rdquo; he told
himself.</p>
<p>Then, of a sudden his eyes fell upon his quiver
of arrows lying on the ground. With an instinct
of preservation harking back perhaps to those remote
days when his ancestors dressed in skins
and lived by hunting with the longbow, he
reached first for his quiver, then his bow.</p>
<p>As he reached for the bow, he caught sight of
a pair of brown heels speeding down the trail.</p>
<p>Instinctively he turned to look in the opposite
direction. That instant his blood froze.</p>
<p>Charging straight at him was a creature terrible
to look upon. Curling yellow tusks six
inches long, jaws that chopped at every bouncing
step, a wild boar of the wilderness, savage, mad
with rage, red-eyed and terrible, had come tearing
out of the jungle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>One instant Johnny stood there paralyzed, the
next, with such automatic precision as only comes
from endless hours of training, his splendid
hands did his bidding.</p>
<p>An arrow flashed into place, the bow string
sang taut, the arrow sped to strike with a dull
spat. The mad beast turning half about uttered
a low grunting roar. The second arrow sped.
The wild boar, rearing high and lunging far,
fell at the boy&rsquo;s feet, dead.</p>
<p>For a moment Johnny stood there motionless.
The whole affair had been thrust upon him so
suddenly that he had been able to form no plan
of action, nor indeed to comprehend the meaning
of it all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No rifles,&rdquo; he told himself at last, thinking
of the natives.</p>
<p>Of a sudden it came to him that he was master
of the situation. More than one pair of eyes had
witnessed the deadly execution of his powerful
yew bow. Eight arrows remained in his quiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one of those natives, nor all of them together
would dare oppose me so long as I have
my bow and arrows,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>As proof of this he saw a man in the tree nearest
him, a look of abject terror on his face, staring
down at him.</p>
<p>Seeing the wild creature lying before him and
knowing the high place which wild pork held in
the esteem of the natives, he drew his clasp knife
to cut the jugular vein and allow the blood to run
free.</p>
<p>Then with a laugh, he tossed his quiver of
arrows over his shoulder, gripped his bow and
turning walked slowly back down the trail that
had led him to that place.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>When Dorn was brought to full consciousness
by Pompee&rsquo;s grip on his arm and his insistent,
&ldquo;Look, <i>Monsieur</i>. Only look!&rdquo; he stared wildly
about him for a moment. Then, following the
direction of the aged native&rsquo;s uplifted and pointing
hand, he strained his eyes in an attempt to
discover some unusual sight at the crest of the
ancient Citadel.</p>
<p>For some little time he saw nothing. The
distant tum-tum-tum of a native drum smote his
ears. That was all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The natives,&rdquo; he said in a surprised whisper.
&ldquo;Why are they here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the natives of to-day.&rdquo; Pompee&rsquo;s
voice seemed to come from the depths of some
echoing chamber. &ldquo;It is a spirit of the past. It
is he, the Emperor, Christophe. I have heard.
I did not believe. Now I see. I believe. It is
he who beats the drum. It is he who walks upon
the wall. He has come back to call his scattered
people together. For what? Who can say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man was trembling from head to foot,
whether from excitement or fear the boy could
not tell.</p>
<p>Just as he finished Dorn&rsquo;s eyes caught the
gleam of two red balls of light. These appeared
to be some eight or ten feet above the top of the
Citadel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they move!&rdquo; he said in a tense whisper.
&ldquo;They move!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Oui Monsieur</i>, they move,&rdquo; said Pompee. &ldquo;It
is he. It is Christophe, the great man of Haiti.
He has come back to walk the walls of his great
work, his Citadel, just as he worked there a hundred
years ago with trowel and mortar.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>Dorn was silent. This thing was weird in the
extreme. He did not wish to believe in spirits.
Yet the night, the silent jungle, the deep shadows
of the fortress so grim and old, the memory of
the bloody deeds that fortress had witnessed
worked powerfully upon him.</p>
<p>Then as he sat there, hands gripped tight,
tense, silent, expectant, he saw the thing clearly.
A figure, a very giant of a man, (or was it a
man?) moved forward at the top of the Citadel.
The moon had climbed to a point where it appeared
as a yellow ball lying on the very crest of
the fortress. And now the giant figure, moving
forward, stood out in bold relief against the ball
of gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Christophe,&rdquo; the aged native murmured.
Dorn could hear his teeth chatter. He was swaying
back and forth with a rhythmic motion that
appeared to accompany the distant beating of the
drum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there, there,&rdquo; again Pompee gripped his
arm, as the giant figure passed on, and a shorter
one moved into the spotlight that was the full
moon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is the bearer of the magic telescope. He
was ever with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. A short figure followed the giant
as he walked on the wall.</p>
<p>A moment longer they watched the strange,
shadowy pair. Then a cloud, drifting in from
the sea, hid the face of the moon and all was
shrouded in darkness.</p>
<p>At that precise moment the drum beats ceased.
Silence and darkness hung about them like a
shroud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is gone,&rdquo; said Pompee. His tone was
deep. &ldquo;He will return. It is a sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sign of what?&rdquo; Dorn asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know? I am but a poor old
man. I am not a <i>Papa Lou</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time they sat there in silence. Then
Dorn said in a quiet tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pompee, tell me of the Magic Telescope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is much to tell, my son.&rdquo; Pompee&rsquo;s
tone too was quiet now. &ldquo;But I will tell you a
little. When the great Christophe came to be our
ruler, men were in the habit of sleeping much in
the sun. The fields were neglected. Weeds and
jungle were everywhere and people were very
poor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Christophe was a great worker. He was not
always a tyrant. In the beginning he loved his
people and dreamed great dreams for them. It
was only when the love of power and gold had
driven out his love of God and the toiling people
that he became a tyrant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At once, when he became emperor, he decreed
that all men should work certain hours every
day, except on holidays and Sundays. That this
decree might surely be put into execution he
bought himself a great, brass telescope. This, a
brown boy from the hills always carried after
the emperor. Many days the emperor wandered
far over the hills and the mountains. Always the
boy and the telescope went with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On some tall pile of rocks the emperor would
stand for hours, looking, looking everywhere. It
has always been said that the telescope had magic
within it; that with it the great man could see
hundreds of miles. I do not know. Certain it
was that many times a man sleeping in the shade
during working hours one day found himself in
a dungeon or on a chain gang the next. Christophe
had seen him from afar.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the telescope?&rdquo; said Dorn eagerly.
&ldquo;Where is it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows, <i>Monsieur</i>? Who can say? That
was all very long ago. Where too is the &lsquo;Rope
of Gold&lsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, where?&rdquo; Dorn echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see, <i>Monsieur</i>. It is time we sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorn rolled up in his blankets. But sleep did
not come at once. Half an hour later Curlie
Carson came creeping back to camp and found
him still wide awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dorn,&rdquo; Curlie said in a low whisper, &ldquo;did
you see anything to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw something that was very strange.&rdquo;
Dorn replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dorn,&rdquo; said Curlie, &ldquo;some wise man has written,
&lsquo;Believe nothing you hear and only half that
you see.&rsquo; That which you have seen to-night belongs
to the half which is not to be believed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorn had only the remotest notion of the
meaning of these strange words. Yet they
brought him a curious sort of comfort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER VI
<br />A STARTLING DISCOVERY</h2>
<p>Night was fast approaching when Curlie
Carson, weary from a long day&rsquo;s tramping,
threw himself down at the foot of a tamarind
tree that shadowed a narrow dried-up stream.
He needed rest and time to think. That day he
had spent in following the trail of Johnny and
the band of natives. Two hours before he had
lost the trail. Now he was far, far away from
the camp at the Citadel and from his improvised
laboratory in the heart of the crumbling old
fortress.</p>
<p>Thoughts of his laboratory there all unguarded
disturbed him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s almost finished,&rdquo;
he grumbled to himself. &ldquo;Be a pity if some
natives would get in and wreck him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Mike,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;All alone in
that gloomy old dungeon. But I guess it&rsquo;s safe
enough for all that.&rdquo; He chuckled. He was
thinking of the fright he had given that native
on the rope ladder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Same natives that spirited Johnny away.&rdquo;
A frown formed on his brow. &ldquo;Wonder what
they&rsquo;ve done to him by now? Why couldn&rsquo;t I
have followed that trail? Why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke short off to stare down at the sandy
bed of the dried up stream. Did he see the print
of a bare foot there! He bent over to look more
closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he told himself, at once alive with fresh
hope. &ldquo;It is a footprint. And there&rsquo;s another,
and yet another. They came this way. Hurray!
I am on the trail again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His joy was short lived. He had not followed
the bed of the stream that had been used as a
trail a dozen yards before he made a startling
discovery. Johnny was no longer with the
group of natives. That this was the same group
of natives, he did not doubt. Two of these men
had peculiar feet, one was nearly clubfooted, the
other had lost a big toe. Their footprints in a
damp spot registered these peculiarities quite
perfectly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be mistaken,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Question
is, what have they done with Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this question he could form no satisfactory
answer. One fact stood out plainly: since he
had come in search of his friend Johnny Thompson,
and since he no longer traveled with this
band, there was no longer any reason for following
this trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back track is better,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;May
find some trace of Johnny. At any rate it will
lead me back to the Citadel, to camp and my
laboratory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wondered in a vague sort of way what
Dorn and old Pompee would think of his prolonged
absence. Would they start out in search
of him? He hoped not. Yet one never could
tell. He had been gone since early morning. It
had been agreed that he should take up the
search for Johnny while Dorn and Pompee
guarded camp and waited for much needed supplies
that Dorn&rsquo;s father had promised to send.</p>
<p>Rising and turning his back on the native
trail, he began making his way back down the
stream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>He had not gone a quarter of a mile before the
trail left the bed of the stream to go branching
away up the slope of a wooded hill.</p>
<p>Shadows were falling fast. It would soon be
quite dark. As the boy hastened on, a breeze
sweeping in from the sea fanned his cheek. It
fanned something else; an all but burned out
camp fire gleamed out anew.</p>
<p>This sudden flash of red caught the boy&rsquo;s eye.
Turning sharply to the right, he took a dozen
steps, then paused in sudden astonishment.</p>
<p>As he stood there before the mildly glowing
camp fire he fancied himself Robinson Crusoe.
On the sands of the beach had he come upon an
abandoned cannibal camp?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they do say that these Haitian natives,
some of them, descended from cannibals and are
not too sure to be free from cannibalism,&rdquo; he
told himself.</p>
<p>A cold chill ran up his spine. All about him
were the evidences of a recently completed feast.
Bones and scraps of half roasted flesh were
everywhere. He thought of his missing friend
and shuddered afresh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>A cloud obscured the setting sun. The world
went dark. The boy found himself paralyzed
with overpowering fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; he managed to stammer. &ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s
no use being foolish. Got&mdash;got to get a grip
on myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he gave the camp fire such a kick as
sent sparks flying and momentarily lighted up
the scene.</p>
<p>Enheartened by this he seized a handful of
dry palm leaves to hurl them on the glowing
coals. In a moment&rsquo;s time he had a bright fire
blazing cheerily.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>In the meantime there was consternation at the
camp by the Citadel. It was bad enough, Dorn
thought, with Johnny Thompson missing. Curlie&rsquo;s
continued absence doubled his anxiety. He
was for plunging at once into the jungle in
search of his lost companions. To this plan
Pompee would not agree. &ldquo;We are but an old
man and a boy,&rdquo; he argued. &ldquo;I am strong, but
being old I have not the endurance of youth.
The jungle would claim me as its own. And
you are too young to care for yourself in so vast
a wilderness.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>Truth was that Pompee, being black, was very
superstitious. The vision he had seen on the
Citadel had seemed to him a warning. He would
much rather have left the place and gone back
to his cabin. But loyalty to his young master
forbade this. One thing he could do&mdash;he could
refuse to lead Dorn into further peril and this
he did with all his heart.</p>
<p>To Dorn, held as he was to enforced idleness
under the most trying circumstances, the tinkling
of a bell that sounded far down the trail
was a godsend. He sprang down that trail expecting
anything and everything. What he
found was a very droll looking donkey, named
Midas. Midas was laden with all manner of
good things to eat, brought straight from Dorn&rsquo;s
own kitchen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>With Midas came Dorn&rsquo;s flaxen-haired cousin
Doris. Doris was from the States. She was of
French descent but her people had lived so long
in America that they had become truly American.
Dorn liked Doris; in fact everyone liked
her. She had a round, smiling face and laughing
blue eyes. A friend never came within hailing
distance of her but they heard her cheery
&ldquo;Whoo hoo!&rdquo; and saw her arm swung high in
greeting.</p>
<p>Doris was now in Haiti for a rather long
visit, while her father was away in Europe on
business, but she had entered so thoroughly into
the life of the island that to her friends and relatives
she already seemed a part of it.</p>
<p>Both Doris and her dark-eyed cousin Dot,
Dorn&rsquo;s sister, had wished to accompany Dorn
and his friends on their exploring trip to the
Citadel. This, Dot&rsquo;s father would not permit.
The best he would allow was an over-night visit
when they brought the supplies. It happened
that when the day came for leading the drowsy
Midas up the mountain with his loaded hampers
Dot was much needed in her father&rsquo;s office. So
Doris and a native girl, Nieta, had come in her
stead. This had brought bitter disappointment
to Dot. She had, however, found some comfort
in the thought that on the night of Doris&rsquo; absence
she could carry out a secret experiment
which she had for a long time contemplated making.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>So here was Doris and the dark Nieta. And
here too was Midas with his full hampers. And
here as well was the marvelous, mysterious Citadel
which must be shown to the girls. Dorn had
a full day of it with little enough time to think
of his missing friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER VII
<br />THE VOODOO DRUM</h2>
<p>But we must not forget Curlie Carson. Lost
from his friends, far away among the hills,
confronted by what seemed the scene of a grim
tragedy, he found himself at first all but overcome
by fear and dread. The brilliant illumination
caused by burning palm leaves, however,
quickly drove from his mind the suggestion that
something sinister and quite horrible had happened
round the half burned out camp fire. A
little back from the fire, beneath a mango tree,
he discovered a broad, sharp-toed hoof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hog,&rdquo; he mumbled to himself.</p>
<p>The next moment he picked up a broad circle
of yellow ivory with edge as keen as a knife
blade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hog,&rdquo; he repeated. A suggestion of awe had
crept into his tone. &ldquo;Tusk of a wild hog. And
what a monster! Wonder who had the hardihood
to face that fellow and kill him. Whoever
it was, he found friends enough to help him pick
the bones. Wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to search about among the palm
leaves and the bushes. To his great joy, he found,
high and dry and quite clean upon a broad leaf
where it had apparently been forgotten, a liberal
slice taken from the great beast&rsquo;s ham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, kind Providence. Don&rsquo;t mind if I
do.&rdquo; He watched the palm leaf fire burn low.
Then raking out a good bed of live coals, placed
his gift from the gods upon it.</p>
<p>At once the evening air was fragrant with
broiling pork steak. A half hour later when
Curlie rose to go it was with a feeling that nature
was good to all mankind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where am I and where is Johnny Thompson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These questions he could not answer. He did
believe that with good fortune he could find his
own way back to camp. This plan, since there
seemed to be no likelihood of his coming upon
his missing friend, he proceeded to put into execution.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>His small flashlight was still with him. By
its light he was able to follow winding trails,
avoid brambles and save himself from many a
fall over hidden rocks and narrow stream beds.</p>
<p>He had been traveling so for some two hours,
when of a sudden, appearing to come from nowhere,
a sound smote his ear. A single boom of
a native drum. It shattered the silence of the
night and set small wild creatures scurrying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; He came to a sudden halt.</p>
<p>A moment of silence and there it was again.
This time three strokes: Tum! Tum! Tum!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over to the right,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Natives.
They may have Johnny. At worst it&rsquo;s to
be one of those forbidden native dances, and
that&rsquo;s something. Something that few enough
white folks see these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited until the drum sounded again.
Tum&mdash;Tum&mdash;Tum&mdash;Tum. Then he struck
straight away in the direction from which the
sound appeared to come. Nor did he pause until
the drummer was so near at hand that the
drum seemed to be his own ears pulsating in wild
rhythm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>Parting the bushes, he peered into the open
space beyond. Before him was a spot quite clear
of trees and bushes. The grass had been cropped
short by wild goats. And there in the center,
squatting low, drum between knees, thumping
the drum with naked hands, was not some
swarthy native drummer but a slim white girl
dressed in a bright blouse and plaid knickers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all places!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Miles from
human habitation. A girl and a drum at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still the girl drummed on. Like one in a
trance she sat with eyes raised to the stars and
sent out such rolls and thunder with such vibrations
as the boy had not heard before.</p>
<p>But even as he listened in awed surprise there
sounded a stealthy movement off to his right, another
to his left. A twig snapped. A branch
made a swishing sound.</p>
<p>He was becoming frightened. Was this some
plot? Was the girl a plant, a lure to lead him
on? He could not believe this. There was about
her face, not a perfectly molded face, but well
cut and strong, something of a look he had seen
on the face of angels in an ancient painting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>No, the girl is not a part of a plot, for now in
a second of silence, she too has caught a sound.
Instantly her drum beats cease. She grips the
drum by a strap and drags it noiselessly into the
brush. Here she backs far into the shadows,
straight toward the spot where Curlie stands. A
step forward, a hand outstretched and he might
touch her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think she&rsquo;d hear my heart beating,&rdquo; he said
to himself, but in the shadows he could not see
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he thought again, &ldquo;the show is over.
But I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>During all this time, where was Johnny
Thompson? Curlie had followed his trail over
many a weary mile in vain. He had come upon
a burned out camp fire and the remains of a
feast of wild pig. This pig, as you have guessed,
was that killed by Johnny. It was this very
beast which had worked his liberation from the
mysterious natives. He had not returned to
camp, for Doris had journeyed to the Citadel,
filled with high hopes of finding him there, only
to have her hopes dashed to the ground. He was
not there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>After retrieving his quiver of arrows and
slaying the wild boar, Johnny had found himself
free to go where he chose. Not one of the
natives who had witnessed his marvelous archery
and the deadly power of his bow dared resist
him.</p>
<p>But where did he wish to go? For a moment
he found himself engaged in a mental struggle.
Strange as it may seem, he felt an almost overwhelming
desire to stay and see this unusual affair
through. There was something to be said
for this course of action. The natives had, more
than likely, saved his life by dragging him from
the pit in the ancient fort. Not one of them all
had laid violent hands upon him. They had
shown him every respect. They had forced him
to come with them; that was all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>What was there back of their actions? Had
they been sent? If so who had sent them and
why? All down the centuries since Columbus
set the ensign of Spain upon these newly discovered
shores, such procedures as this had come
about. A queen of some distant tribe takes a
fancy to some gallant young Spaniard. She
sends a band of men for him. He is brought,
whether he wills it or not, to the court. There,
in time he is showered with riches and made a
king.</p>
<p>A native chief learns that gold and odd bits of
jewelry can be traded for steel knives, hawk&rsquo;s
bells and bright silk scarfs. His kingdom is far
away. He sends a band to waylay a trader and
bring him from afar, only to at last return him
unharmed and laden with rich treasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that,&rdquo; the boy told himself, &ldquo;was very
long ago. There&rsquo;s no use romancing. Dorn and
Pompee will be worried about me. Curlie will
risk his neck to find me. I must return to camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some persons are natural scouts. To them an
overturned pebble, a bent twig, moss on trees, a
thousand simple things, are a sign. Johnny was
not of this brotherhood.</p>
<p>Just as night began to fall he found himself
descending a gently sloping hillside where the
ground was red as a native clay pipe when, upon
rounding a curve, he came within sight of a
small, square house that gleamed white in the
light of the setting sun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Now I shall not
spend the night alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this he was mistaken. As he neared the
place, no dog came out to bark a warning, no
naked native children scurried through the doorway
to their mother. The place was silent, deserted,
lonely. Yet in the fact that this had once
been a home; that children had once played with
young goats before the door; that a mother had
beaten corn for bread and a father had returned
from a day of toil, Johnny found comfort. For
this boy Johnny was an exceptional character.
Himself a wanderer, he was ever dreaming of
home, ever thinking of that time when, with
loved ones about him, he would sit before his own
hearth fire in a home he called his own.</p>
<p>Having explored the half ruined house and
found its roof sound, he brought in dry banana
leaves to make a bed on the shelf beneath the
rafters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>He found ripe bananas in a little run below
the house. Half content with this sparse supply
of food, he sat down to listen. Nor did he listen
long. From above him, on the sloping hillside
which had once been a badly cleared cornfield,
there came a sound much like a shrill scream.</p>
<p>Stringing his bow and nocking an arrow, he
began scouting away up the hill. Now he peered
out from behind a clump of young banana
plants. And now a great boulder hid him. Now
he crept rapidly over a patch of barren red soil.
But ever he moved upward. Now and then to
his listening ears came welcome sounds, cries,
calls, duckings that told him that the quarry
was not far away.</p>
<p>And now, as he lifted his head above a low-growing
bush, he caught his breath as he murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now! Now&rsquo;s the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bending his bow for a quick aim, he let fly.
Then such a screaming and whirring of wings!
A whole covey of wild guinea fowl went wheeling
and screaming away into the sunset. A
whole covey? Not quite. A fat young cock lay
still upon a flat rock. He had been shot through
and through by one of Johnny&rsquo;s arrows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Supper!&rdquo; the boy exulted as he lifted the bird
from the rock and retrieved his arrow.</p>
<p>There were dry branches to be had from the
trees in the nearest run. These were rapidly converted
into a heap of glowing coals. Lacking a
kettle for boiling his fowl, Johnny first plucked
off the feathers then rolled it in a two inch coat
of red clay. After that he buried it, clay and
all, beneath a great mound of glowing coals and
sat down to await results.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; he told himself as he sat there with
the abandoned home at his back, &ldquo;is strange.
Here was this chap who made this place a home.
To him five dollars a year was a fortune. Wild
guineas shot or snared, bananas and mangoes
growing in the runs, corn from the hills, goat&rsquo;s
meat and goat&rsquo;s milk, all to be had for the asking.
These were his. And clothes,&rdquo; he chuckled,
&ldquo;down here a long shirt and a broad smile
makes a wonderful suit, better than the best
dress suit a tailor ever made.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But back where I came from,&rdquo; he mused on,
&ldquo;a dress suit, a business suit, golf suit, top coat,
winter coat, rain coat, high shoes, oxfords, golf
shoes, tennis shoes, scarfs, shirts, collars, socks
by the dozen. Men work days, nights and sometimes
Sundays for a living wage. And how
much is a living wage? Two thousand, three
thousand, five thousand dollars. Poor souls!
They grow gray and go to hospitals, sanitariums,
and early graves. And here a man lives well
enough on five dollars a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seizing a stout stick he scattered the coals to
right and left. An oval mound of hard, baked
clay lay before him. This he cracked with a
rock and behold! Before him lay a feast fit for
a king, a guinea fowl baked in clay among the
coals.</p>
<p>As he lay down to sleep on that narrow shelf
beneath the rafters, he tried to imagine the natures
of those who had slept there before him.
Their images did not linger long for he was soon
lost in slumber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER VIII
<br />THE YELLOW SNAKE&rsquo;S TEETH</h2>
<p>Dorn looked at the Citadel and all connected
with it through the big, round eyes
of a young boy. Nothing would do but his fair-haired
American cousin, Doris, must climb all
those stone steps leading up to the top of the
Citadel, there to peer down into the dark hole
that had been Johnny&rsquo;s prison and from which
he had mysteriously vanished.</p>
<p>Doris exclaimed and shrank back from the
darkness of the place. Then seized with a true
girl&rsquo;s impulse, she took a fishing line and hook
from her knicker pocket and angled until she
drew Johnny&rsquo;s handkerchief up from those forbidding
depths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be learned from that?&rdquo; Dorn asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably nothing,&rdquo; replied Doris. &ldquo;Anyway
I have his handkerchief to remember him by if
he is never seen again, haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Remember him? You&rsquo;ve never seen him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can remember him all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This point Dorn did not care to discuss. So
they moved onward over the moss grown roof of
the ancient fortress until they stood upon the exact
spot at which the shadowy giant of the night
before had appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He stood right here,&rdquo; said Dorn in an awed
tone. &ldquo;He moved right along there. And the
little fellow, the bearer of the brass telescope, followed
after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris had heard the story of the mysterious
walking giant twice before, but to be standing at
the very spot where the vision had appeared gave
her an added thrill.</p>
<p>The sun was setting. Already half the world
was in shadows. As she stood there she found
her knees trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get away from here.&rdquo; She moved forward
unsteadily.</p>
<p>Behind her sounded the chattering of teeth
mingled with mumbled whisperings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nieta,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what in the world are you
doing?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She is talking to her teeth,&rdquo; whispered Dorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her teeth!&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s tone showed unfeigned
amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Her snake&rsquo;s teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snake&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said her cousin.
&ldquo;Nieta believes in the power of voodoo charms.
Her uncle, who is now dead, left her a very ancient
charm. She wears it round her neck in a
leather sack. It is the teeth of a yellow snake
killed at the back of a cave at high tide when the
moon was dark. It has great power, so they say.
She is afraid now, so she is asking the spirit of
the yellow snake for protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Doris shuddered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather trust
the ghost of that old emperor&mdash;if there truly is a
ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw him&mdash;Pompee and I.&rdquo; Dorn&rsquo;s
voice carried conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look!&rdquo; said Doris, pointing to a spot
where a patch of green moss had been torn up.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a donkey&rsquo;s track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; said Dorn. &ldquo;No donkey has been
here. Think of his coming up those steps!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But he has,&rdquo; said Doris. &ldquo;Look! There&rsquo;s
another footprint. And over there&rsquo;s another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fresh mystery,&rdquo; said Dorn, acknowledging
the proof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we must be getting down. Don&rsquo;t want
to be caught up here in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;o,&rdquo; said Doris. &ldquo;We do not.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">But we must not forget Curlie Carson and the
strange girl who drummed so mysteriously in the
night upon a native drum.</p>
<p>The show which Curlie had thought ended
when the strange dark-haired girl stepped from
the greensward stage to his corner of hiding was
continued and that almost at once. Curlie found
time to note only one further fact. Crouching
close beside the girl was an unusually large dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hate to mix with him,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>The next instant his attention was drawn back
to the narrow stretch of green. Figures were
darting back and forth across the narrow clearing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Those can&rsquo;t be wild creatures,&rdquo; Curlie told
himself. &ldquo;There are none in the island like that.
They&rsquo;re natives. And the girl has called them
with the drum. What can they be doing at such
an hour in such a place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dared not move. He studied the girl.
She seemed frightened, about to flee; yet she remained
there motionless. As they crouched there
a fourth, a fifth, sixth, eighth, tenth, twelfth
figure passed across the star-lit clearing.</p>
<p>In time he lost much of his fear. The natives
were some distance away. There was the girl
and her dog. The girl might need protection.
He doubted this, and curiosity came to take the
place of fear. So he lingered.</p>
<p>The thing he was about to witness might seem
to belong to those long lost days on the Hudson
that Washington Irving is so fond of writing
about. Be that as it may the strange panorama
of that hour will never pass from his memory.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the dark, a drum was struck.
At the same instant a dusky figure darted to the
center of the spot of ground before him and as if
by magic flames leaped up. After that came the
steady red glow of a slow fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Again the drum, again and yet again. Figures
appeared. They began leaping about the
fire. Like black ghosts they were now within
the circle of light and now lost within the shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did they come to this spot?&rdquo; he asked
himself. &ldquo;There are a thousand grass grown
clearings in the hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There could be but one answer to this. The
girl had drummed. Had she meant them to
come? If so, then why had she hidden? Why
did she seem so much afraid?</p>
<p>At once his mind was filled with pictures of
the past. All the sad and tragic history of the
island of Haiti, all the bright days, too, passed
before his mind&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>The brief, bright, glorious days of the French
Colony, bright for a few, dark for many slaves,
came and went.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>The drum was beating now. Rolling, throbbing,
singing, if a drum may be said to sing, it
was telling out the story of the uprising of the
natives and the slaves; telling how just such a
goat&rsquo;s head drum had sent out the signals, how
another, another and yet a hundred others had
taken up the notes until all the island heard.
Down through all the bright and bitter years, of
rebellion, war, slavery and freedom, the drums
had played their part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now?&rdquo; he thought as the drumming rose
louder and the dancers leaped in wilder circles,
&ldquo;now what can they want? It is their land.
This is a republic. They are free. True, there
are the Marines. But they are the servants of
this nation as well as our own. They are here
to help the people find their way out.&rdquo; There
came a pause in his thoughts. There had been
rumors of intrigue against the present government.
In every land there are the dissatisfied
ones, especially in a small republic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this girl, this American girl,&rdquo; he
thought, &ldquo;has called them together for this.&rdquo;
The thing seemed unbelievable, yet had he not
seen her drumming the signal call?</p>
<p>His thoughts broke short off. From before
him there had sounded a shrill whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we could get their goat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>He heard the words plainly but could not believe
his ears. The words had come from the
girl&rsquo;s lips. She had discovered him and had not
cried out in fright. What a truly remarkable
girl!</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we could get their goat,&rdquo; she repeated,
for all the world as if she had known him always,
and as if he should understand what she
meant.</p>
<p>Once more Curlie&rsquo;s heart leaped. Who was
this strange girl? What could she mean?</p>
<p>For the answer to this second question, he had
not long to wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got a goat, a very black goat.&rdquo; The
girl&rsquo;s whisper was low but distinct. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
going to sacrifice it. It&rsquo;s a voodoo custom, you
know. There are always the witch doctors to
lead them on. And besides, just now there is
Pluto. Pluto is a big, bad man, a sort of leader,
who wants money and power. He thinks he can
drive the Marines away and overturn the government.
He will make these people mad with wild
dances. Then <i>Papa Lou</i> will sacrifice the black
goat which they think will bring them success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get their goat.&rdquo; Curlie whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There may be a rebellion,&rdquo; the girl urged.
&ldquo;Lives may be lost. If only we could somehow
break up the meeting; the meeting I must have
called without meaning to. If only we could!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the dog,&rdquo; suggested Curlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;He is my protector.
He&rsquo;s very good. He won&rsquo;t hurt you. But I
wouldn&rsquo;t think of sicking him on. He&rsquo;d be
killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment, save for the mad tum-tum of
the drum, there was silence. Then Curlie, leaning
close, asked in a low tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will he howl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your dog. Can you make him howl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why yes, I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make him howl then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make him howl. There&rsquo;s no time for explaining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be ready to fly,&rdquo; Curlie added. &ldquo;Follow me.
I know a secret way down the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>With trembling fingers the girl drew a small
harmonica from her pocket. Then she touched
the dog who had all this time stood tense at her
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Leo, old boy,&rdquo; she whispered hoarsely
as the throb of the drum rose louder and a
chanted song rose and fell like the wild waves of
the sea. &ldquo;Now Leo, do your bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put the tiny musical instrument to her lips
and sent forth a piercing discordant screech.</p>
<p>The next instant Leo stood on his haunches
and pointing his nose to the stars let out such a
mournful wail as only a tropical dog knows.</p>
<p>The effect was electrical. With a loud <i>bam</i>,
the drum beats ceased. The song broke off short.
For ten seconds silence, deep and ominous, hung
over the jungle. Then again came that unearthly
screech and the dog&rsquo;s answering wail.</p>
<p>This last was too much. Came the sound of
rushing through the brush, the bleating of a
black goat being dragged over the rough trail
by his masters. All this grew indistinct in the
night. Then again silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be any rebellion now,&rdquo; said Curlie.
&ldquo;At least not right away. They thought it
was the <i>Loupe Garoe</i>. That is a bad sign.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Loupe Garoe</i>?&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Curlie. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;d better be getting
down. Some of them might suspect. It
wouldn&rsquo;t be nice to be found here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These natives,&rdquo; Curlie said as they crept
along down a steep trail, &ldquo;as you know of course,
are very superstitious. It&rsquo;s a pity. One who is
afraid of many things is never happy. Voodooism
is really a sort of Devil worship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are afraid to offend the <i>Mama Lou</i> and
the <i>Papa Lou</i>, who are witch doctors. But most
of all they are afraid of the <i>Loupe Garoe</i>, who
doesn&rsquo;t exist at all, except in their imaginations.
When your dog howled they thought him the
<i>Loupe Garoe</i> who, so they believe, is half wolf
and half man. He carries off little children and
when he is about it is a very bad sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard all that,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;but I
didn&rsquo;t think of it in the way you did. You are
a wise one. I thank you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we could get their goat,&rdquo; she said
after a time. &ldquo;Goats that are all black are hard
to find and according to their superstitious notions,
only an all black goat will suffice for a
sacrifice before some desperate undertaking.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>In a moment of stress and great danger, perfect
strangers become comrades for the hour.
Once the danger is passed they more often than
not become strangers once more. It was so with
Curlie and the girl, or so it seemed to Curlie.
He had hoped she would tell him who she was
and where she lived. She did not. She told him
nothing.</p>
<p>One thing he did not need to be told. They
had not been scouting down the trail for a half
hour before he realized that she needed no directing
from him. She was far better acquainted with
the jungle than he. Once when he hesitated at
a forking of the way, she forged straight on. At
another time she gripped his arm just in time to
save him from a dangerous fall. At this time he
learned one more fact; slender girl that she was,
there was power in her good right arm. Hers
was the grip of a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go this way,&rdquo; she said quite suddenly when,
after an hour of almost unbroken silence, they
came to a fork in the trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>Curlie found himself sorely tempted to say,
&ldquo;So do I.&rdquo; But this he knew would be an untruth.</p>
<p>Since he valued truth and above all prized
this girl&rsquo;s opinion, he said, &ldquo;I go up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Good night, and thank you.&rdquo; He
found his hand caught for a second in a firm
clasp. The next instant she was gone; swallowed
up by the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a queer girl; but a real one,&rdquo; he told
himself as he toiled up the trail. &ldquo;Wonder why
she beat out those signals on the drum if she
didn&rsquo;t want those natives to meet? Who is she?
Where&rsquo;s her home? Will we meet again?&rdquo; He
hoped so. Yet in this strange old world one
never could tell.</p>
<p>The night was well spent. His eyes were
heavy with sleep. At this elevation there were
no flying pests. The trail was still long. It
would be there in the morning.</p>
<p>Selecting a gently sloping bank beneath a
tropical oak, he gathered moss from low hanging
branches to form a pillow. He then threw
himself upon the earth, closed his eyes and fell
asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER IX
<br />THE JEWELED MONKEY</h2>
<p>Johnny Thompson did not in the least
mind being lost. Truth was he got much joy
from it. The sky was so blue, the morning air,
as he left the abandoned native home, so crisp
and balmy, he felt like singing a song.</p>
<p>True, he disliked worrying his friends, but
the island of Haiti is not the world. He would
find his way back in time. He had breakfasted
well on cold guinea meat, parched corn and
bananas. His bow and quiver of arrows were
slung across his back. The trail was before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With wild fruit and game I could live a half
year through,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>For some time he made his way through rough
uplands, where trees and brush obstructed his
travel and only wild trails helped him on his
way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>At last, however, he came upon an ancient
man-made trail that led over a ridge and down
upon the other side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I shall find my way to somewhere,&rdquo; he
told himself. But this trail ran through rough
uncultivated land. Mid-afternoon found him
apparently some distance still from human habitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well,&rdquo; he sighed dropping down beside a
cool spring, &ldquo;the afternoon is hot. Guess I&rsquo;ll rest
a while. The evening will be cool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had he persevered for another quarter of a
mile he most surely would have met with a surprise;
for there browsing close to the trail was a
donkey, and on his back were two empty hampers.
A few yards up the bank in the deep shade,
he might have discovered two unusual patches of
color, one orange, the other red. The orange
spot was a white girl&rsquo;s jacket, the red a native
girl&rsquo;s dress. Had he explored still further he
would have found that the two girls were resting
from the heat of the day. And these girls, as
you may have guessed, were Doris and Nieta.
They had chosen to return home from the ancient
fort by a new and little used trail. Midas had
not liked the plan. He had shown his displeasure
by using a snail-like pace and by offering to eat
every tree and bush that grew beside the trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>At last, quite worn out by her constant flogging
of the obstinate donkey Doris had given in
to his whims and had allowed him to wander as
he willed while she and Nieta rested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t lose a donkey,&rdquo; she had said to
Nieta. &ldquo;Not completely. He&rsquo;ll always find his
way home. And he has nothing on his back but
empty hampers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had been sitting there for some time
dreamily gazing at the wavering patterns of sunlight
and shadows woven on the mossy earth or
looking up into the treetops when Doris gave a
sudden start. Her eye had caught a peculiar
gleam of white light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can it be?&rdquo; she asked herself. &ldquo;There
is nothing about a palm tree to reflect light that
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She puzzled about this for some time. Then,
since her keen eyes did not succeed in detecting
the cause, she fell to wondering about Midas who
had disappeared down the trail. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s gone
home by himself it will be a blessing,&rdquo; she told
herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are no lions and tigers to fear here.
There are some very terrible snakes and lizards
five feet long and wild hogs with tusks like razor
blades, but they&rsquo;re not likely to trouble us.
We&mdash;&rdquo; She broke short off to stare. Once more
in the midst of dense foliage she had caught that
white flash of light. So white! So intense! Like
the flash that comes from a mirror, only sharper
and brighter. She caught her breath. There it
was again. Here it was, there. Now, like a
glimmering ghost, it was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick as lightning.&rdquo; She glanced through
the leafy branches to the sky. Pale blue the sky
was, not a cloud. She had suspected lightning.
&ldquo;But no,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s four hours before
shower-time.&rdquo; Showers come with a convenient
regularity in Haiti.</p>
<p>She studied the scanty leaves and many dry
pods that hung directly above her. They had
seated themselves beneath a &ldquo;chattering woman,&rdquo;
or so this odd tree is called. It was loaded with
dry pods. These pods rattle and chatter in the
wind. At this moment there was no wind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>Slowly her eyes roved over the dangling pods.
Then, of a sudden, her gaze became fixed, her
lips parted in a scream that died in forming.</p>
<p>Directly above her, peering down at her, was
the smallest, strangest little face she had ever
seen. The eyes were so wide in question, the
brow so wrinkled, the whole expression so broadly
intelligent that for the briefest part of a moment
she was tempted to believe the creature human.
He was, she realized at once, a marmoset, one of
those smallest of monkeys who are so popular as
pets among South American ladies of quality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you monk! You cute little monkey!
Where did you come from?&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>The monkey blinked his eyes three times, then,
as if to hide himself from her, put both hands
over his eyes.</p>
<p>It was this movement that brought a low exclamation
to the girl&rsquo;s lips for, once again, at the
very instant his slim arms moved, there came that
brilliant flash of light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did it!&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;A monkey!
But how could he?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>The answer came at once and with such sudden
surprise as fairly sent her senses reeling. On
the monkey&rsquo;s left forearm, like a lady&rsquo;s bejeweled
bracelet, there gleamed a ring, set with a
white stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a diamond,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;a very
large diamond! No bit of glass could flash like
that. But where did he get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her mind was formed what she believed to
be the answer. This was a pet monkey. There
could be no question about that, for there are no
wild monkeys in Haiti. This monkey had stolen
his mistress&rsquo; diamond ring and made away with
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should be worth hundreds of dollars,&rdquo; she
told herself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably a wedding ring, a
priceless possession. Somehow we must catch
the monkey and take the ring from him. He
may tire of it and hide it or throw it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old it seems,&rdquo; she told herself after a
moment&rsquo;s study. &ldquo;All corroded. Can&rsquo;t have
been worn for years. But how the diamond
sparkles!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>Again the white stone flashed, as the monkey
uncovered his eyes to resume his worried study
of these strangers who had invaded his domain.</p>
<p>Doris touched the drowsy Nieta on the arm.
Then, after placing a finger to lips for silence,
pointed up at the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh&rsquo;sh! Don&rsquo;t speak,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Look
up, up there among the pods on that thick
branch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nieta did look up. She started suddenly and
found herself staring and fully awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; Doris whispered. &ldquo;See that on his arm?
It&rsquo;s a diamond ring; must be. And we must get
it. Think of the reward! Think&mdash;if we never
found the owner at all! Think&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;Oh!&rdquo; she fairly cried. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone!
Hurry! Hurry!&rdquo; she whispered excitedly.
&ldquo;Look! Look everywhere! We mustn&rsquo;t lose
him! Think Nieta, think of the reward. Think
if we find no owner at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The native girl&rsquo;s eyes were bulging.</p>
<p>At that precise moment, Johnny Thompson
came swinging down the trail.</p>
<p>At sight of the two excited girls he stopped
short to stare in astonishment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Babes in the woods,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;Now
where is the wicked old queen or the dragon, or&mdash;Oh,
now I know,&rdquo; he said changing his tone.
&ldquo;You are Doris, Dorn&rsquo;s cousin. He&rsquo;s told me all
about you. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget about it and be quiet.&rdquo; Doris took a
step toward him. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a monkey in this tree
and he has a diamond ring on his arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a monkey!&rdquo; The boy stared as if he
thought her out of her senses. &ldquo;A diamond ring
on a monkey&rsquo;s arm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, I tell you.&rdquo; Doris put a finger
over his lips. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. I&mdash;we&mdash;we saw him!
There! There he goes now!&rdquo; she exclaimed as
a brown streak surging from a branch set the
dry pods rattling, then vaulted into the top of a
cocoanut palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there he leaps again,&rdquo; said Johnny, losing
himself in wild excitement. &ldquo;Come on.
We&rsquo;ll get him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all went tumbling down the hill.</p>
<p>They were quite out of sight of the &ldquo;chattering
woman&rdquo; and still following the monkey when
Doris stopped short. &ldquo;I&mdash;I think I saw him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where? Where is he?&rdquo; demanded Nieta.
Her eyes were wide with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There!&rdquo; The white girl&rsquo;s words
came in a shrill whisper. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s up in that small
mahogany tree looking down at us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s come to rest,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;All we
have to do now is to coax him down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-e-s,&rdquo; said Doris, doubtfully. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
They sat down side by side on a big flat stone
to stare up at the grinning monkey and to catch
now and then a fleeting glance of that gleaming
stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a diamond all right,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;And
my! what a whopper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said a moment later. &ldquo;Monkeys
like bananas. I saw a clump of wild ones back
there. Perhaps I can find some ripe ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was gone Doris kept her eyes on the
monkey, but once when she glanced down at
Nieta she found to her surprise that she was paying
no attention to the monkey. Instead, she had
taken some curious white objects from a small
leather sack carried by a string round her neck
and was whispering to them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nieta!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;What in the world
are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These,&rdquo; said Nieta quite soberly, &ldquo;are the
teeth of a yellow snake killed in the back of a
cave in the dark of the moon. They are a powerful
voodoo charm. They were given me by a
very wise <i>Papa Lou</i>. A <i>Papa Lou</i> is a voodoo
priest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once Doris recalled what Dorn had told her
of the strange voodoo charm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The snake, you know,&rdquo; Nieta went on quite
solemnly, &ldquo;is able when alive to charm a monkey.
When the snake is dead his spirit remains near
his teeth. I am telling him to charm the monkey
and bring him down to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nieta,&rdquo; said Doris, shocked beyond belief,
&ldquo;you must not think such things. They are not
true. It is truly wicked to believe them. There
is but one living spirit outside ourselves and that
is the spirit of the great Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you not pray to that spirit?&rdquo; The
native girl&rsquo;s brow wrinkled. &ldquo;Do you not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Doris gripped her arm. &ldquo;He leaped
away over there. He&mdash;he&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>By the time Johnny caught up with them, the
monkey, by a succession of tree races and wild
flying leaps, had led the girls down a precipitous
slope to a spot where a rocky ledge hanging over
a drop of some fifty feet brought their race and
the monkey&rsquo;s to an end.</p>
<p>The monkey climbed out on a branch that appeared
to hang over a precipice. He seemed at
first to contemplate a flying leap to the top of a
tall tree that grew on the lower slope. This
would have proven a thrilling spectacle. Doris
caught her breath as he hung there by one foot,
looking down. The distance was thirty feet or
more, a straight drop down. Would he do it?
Dared he?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said gripping at her breast. &ldquo;If he
dares we will never see him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently Mr. Monk did not dare, for in
time he drew himself up to a position of safety,
then began polishing the glistening stone mounting
of the ring with the furry back of his right
hand.</p>
<p>From time to time he would pause to give the
girls a knowing look and wink as if to say:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See! Doesn&rsquo;t it shine? Don&rsquo;t you wish you
had it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In good time Johnny caught up with them.
They were delighted to see that his arms were
filled with small ripe bananas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are really good,&rdquo; he said, slipping the
last bite of one in his mouth. &ldquo;Ripened in the
shade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There followed the age old drama of a boy
with something in his possession and a monkey
who wants it. The monkey had been someone&rsquo;s
pet. For this reason he did not have the fear of
humans that possesses a wild monkey. Yet these
children were strangers. More than that, two
were white. His master had beyond doubt been
a dusky native. He was in no hurry to come
down. He came one branch at a time with many
a backward look. More than once he paused to
polish his diamond and wink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get him,&rdquo; said Johnny half beside himself
with suppressed excitement. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see!
He&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>He was coming. Little by little, branch by
branch, he came. Now he was half way down,
now three quarters. Now he was five yards away,
now four, three, two. He stared wistfully at the
banana held high.</p>
<p>Then, of a sudden, with a speed that was
astonishing, he leaped.</p>
<p>Not upon another branch did he land, nor upon
the ground, but squarely on the top of
Johnny&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>So surprised was Johnny that he jumped and
yelled.</p>
<p>Came a snatching at his hand, then monkey
and banana were gone&mdash;gone not up but down.</p>
<p>Leaping to the top of the ledge the monkey
paused for a second to place the banana between
his teeth, then without so much as a backward
look, lowered himself over the precipice and was
gone.</p>
<p>Throwing herself flat on the ground, then
crawling slowly forward until the steep surface
of the cliff was within her view, Doris watched
him throw himself from fissure to fissure and
from one narrow ledge to the next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be killed,&rdquo; she said breathlessly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>But he was not. Almost before she could realize
it, he had reached a spot near the bottom,
where by a daring leap, he reached the top of a
tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;ve lost him,&rdquo; she half sobbed.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never see him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Nieta with a sudden start.</p>
<p>They did listen and to their waiting ears came
the dull roll of distant thunder. In their wild
chase they had completely forgotten that the
time for the day&rsquo;s thunderstorm was at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; Johnny asked.</p>
<p>Where indeed? The trail was far above them.
Should they attempt to find it they must surely
be half drowned before they reached it. A Haitian
thunderstorm in the jungle is a fearful
thing to contemplate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better skirt the top of this cliff and
make our way down to the sea,&rdquo; said Doris.
&ldquo;There must be some thatched huts down there
that will furnish shelter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acting upon this plan, they dashed away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>The race after the monkey was nothing to this
mad race with the storm. Now creeping along
a rocky ledge, now clinging to a stout vine and
dropping down, down, down, now racing over a
wild hog&rsquo;s trail, now leaping a fallen tree to tear
through a clump of brambles with the rumble
and roar of the storm ever increasing they made
their way forward, until, with a sudden breathless
whoop, Johnny stopped at the edge of a wild
cocoanut jungle to stare at the silent, blue-black
sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a hut,&rdquo; Doris moaned as her eyes swept
the narrow coral beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that yonder?&rdquo; Johnny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A boat! A boat on the beach!&rdquo; Doris exclaimed.
&ldquo;Hurray! We will tip it over and
make a shelter of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if we will ever see him again,&rdquo; she
said to herself as, on reaching the beach, she
paused for breath. She was thinking of the
monkey with the jeweled arm.</p>
<p>The next instant a blinding flash of lightning
and a crash of thunder sent her flying toward the
boat, that seen from the level now seemed much
larger and very far away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never make it,&rdquo; she panted sobbingly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be half drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br />CHAPTER X
<br />STOWAWAYS</h2>
<p>That the boat they had sighted was a large
one, far too large to be tipped on its side
they learned soon enough; not, however, until
they had become utterly exhausted by their mad
race with the storm.</p>
<p>And such a storm as it promised to be. The
sky was inky black. The mountains, the nearby
hills, even the cocoanut groves were blotted out.
The sea, a sheet black as iron lay so still it appeared
that one might walk upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cou&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t turn it over. If it&mdash;it was
only a bark canoe! And look!&rdquo; Doris panted.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a young ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was indeed. The craft they had taken for
a row-boat was a square masted schooner, with
mast thrown carelessly over the side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might get under the sail,&rdquo; suggested
Doris.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Too much wind,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;Blow away.
Give me a hand. I&rsquo;ll look inside of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris gave him a lift and up he went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&mdash;ho!&rdquo; he cried ten seconds later. &ldquo;What
luck! A cabin, a regular canvas cabin in her
prow. And not a soul on board. Give us your
hand and up you come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But dare we?&rdquo; screamed Doris above the roar
of the storm.</p>
<p>There was no time for answering this question.
The storm was upon them. She could see it racing
in white sheets down the beach.</p>
<p>Up they went, up and over, scramble, tumble,
scramble, and they were there, all hidden in the
prow with a roof of stout painted canvas over
their heads and a brown curtain of the same
material hanging before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could be sweeter?&rdquo; said Johnny, dropping
into a corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How it rains!&rdquo; Doris shuddered as torrents
of water came pelting down.</p>
<p>Once more the native girl was whispering to
her snake tooth charm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>Nieta was the only member of the little party
who really feared lightning. Now they were
sheltered from the rain and far from tall trees,
where danger from lightning really lurks, Doris
and Johnny settled back each in a dark corner
for a good rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder whose boat it is?&rdquo; said Doris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Native boat,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;Tell by the way
the canvas is sewed and the boards are nailed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably came from Cape Haitian,&rdquo; said
Doris. &ldquo;Gone up in the hills to hunt wild guineas
or cocoanuts. We&rsquo;ll get them to take us to
town with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a consoling thought. To trek back
up the mountain in the dark and wet after the
storm would be difficult indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder where Mr. Monk is?&rdquo; said Doris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s curious about that ring,&rdquo; said Johnny.
&ldquo;It looked old&mdash;old as the hills. The gold was
all tarnished and the stone didn&rsquo;t look a bit like
the ones I&rsquo;ve seen; wasn&rsquo;t cut the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris made no answer to this. She had suddenly
recalled some strange stories told to her
by a very old black woman of Cape Haitian. The
stories had to do with days long gone by. They
told of the rule of Christophe, the only powerful
emperor Haiti has ever known.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And Honey,&rdquo; the toothless old crone had said
to her, &ldquo;I had it right from my own Mammy
and I know it&rsquo;s true; the ladies of that Emperor&rsquo;s
court wore diamonds and rubies and pearls, such
jewels as you only hear of now, but don&rsquo;t most
never see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when the uprisin&rsquo; came and the Emperor
was expectin&rsquo; to be overthrowed, the wicked old
Emperor took all the jewels an&rsquo; gold an&rsquo; buried
it somewheres; nobody&rsquo;s found out where. No
Honey, not nobody has ever found it yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if&mdash;&rdquo; Doris thought to herself now.
&ldquo;But then of course that could never be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; she added a moment later,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll never see the monkey again, so how could
we follow him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, because she was far from her home and
her new found friend, Johnny Thompson, was
near at hand, because the wild beat of the storm
gave her a feeling of loneliness and a longing
for someone to confide in, she told him of her
day dreams, of her hope that she might find the
monkey and follow him to the hiding place of
the ancient treasure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There must be something to that story of the
hidden treasure of the black Empress,&rdquo; said
Johnny quite soberly. &ldquo;Of course there are many
wild tales told of that romantic king of the
blacks. This much is history. I read it in a
book written six years after his death. When
the emperor felt his throne crumbling beneath
him he went one evening to the Citadel. There
he worked until past midnight. At two o&rsquo;clock
in the morning he knocked at the door of one of
his dukes, a trusted ally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The duchess opened the door and was frightened
half out of her wits. The emperor said
nothing was wrong. He required the service of
the duke; that was all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The duke dressed, then accompanied him to
the castle. At the back of the castle they entered
a door to drag forth a strong box. It was all the
two of them could do to lift it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Having carried it a little way they hid it, so
the story goes. When the work was done the
emperor explained to his ally that the box was
filled with the queen&rsquo;s treasures; that, if anything
ever happened to him, there was enough
there to support his family in comfort for many
years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few days more and the emperor was dead.&rdquo;
Johnny&rsquo;s story was at an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the treasure?&rdquo; Doris leaned eagerly
forward trying to read his face in the half darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows about that?&rdquo; Johnny laughed a
low laugh. &ldquo;If we knew where it was hidden
we would go for it. If that had been told in the
book, the treasure would have been removed long
ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as anyone knows, the duke never betrayed
the emperor&rsquo;s secret. Perhaps he too died
during the uprising. As for the queen, everyone
knows that she sailed for Europe on the first
available boat and never returned to Haiti.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he explained, as he felt that Doris
was about to ask one more question, &ldquo;the Emperor
had sent a great deal of gold to England
by a sea captain he trusted. This was at the
queen&rsquo;s disposal. Since it was enough why risk
her head by a return to Haiti in search of further
wealth?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he added, with another low laugh, &ldquo;the
treasure is yours; provided you find it. I too
have been on a search for some of the emperor&rsquo;s
treasure, the &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;How have you
succeeded? When I was at your camp you were
mysteriously absent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny told her of his search, of Curlie Carson&rsquo;s
strange doings, of his kidnapping by the
natives, and his all but miraculous escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so here we are,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Two treasure
hunters lost in the night and the storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&mdash;here&rsquo;s wishing you luck,&rdquo; said Doris,
reaching out in the half darkness to grip his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say,&rdquo; Johnny asked, &ldquo;what would you do
with all those diamonds, rubies and all that if
you found them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d sell them. Don&rsquo;t care much for jewels.
They&rsquo;re too hard to keep. People steal them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; she half closed her eyes, to lean
far back in her corner, &ldquo;then I&rsquo;d buy dresses and
shoes and things like that. I like bright things.
I want a blue dress with orange trimmings and
an orange dress with blue trimmings, and a
green dress with an old gold sash, and a white
dress with a pink sash; all of them silk, real
shimmering silk that shines in the moonlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Johnny quite suddenly, &ldquo;will do.
Here&rsquo;s hoping you never find them. I like girls
with arms strong as a man&rsquo;s, who can hike ten
miles and who mostly wear khaki knickers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he set the gleam of his flashlight
measuring her up and down, &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s what
spells happiness for you, you should have all
your dresses and wear them too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that you also want a
fur coat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, in sudden anger. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. I
want a midnight blue cape with an Alaskan
white fox collar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Johnny at once sorry for his
caustic remarks, &ldquo;shows your good taste. I&rsquo;ve
been in Alaska. Know real fur when I see it. And
like it as well as you. Here,&rdquo; he said, putting
out a hand, &ldquo;is wishing you best of luck and
happiness! Everyone in the world has a right
to happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I say!&rdquo; he exclaimed after a brief silence.
&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you like some lunch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! Please serve it at once,&rdquo; laughed
Doris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fooling. Pockets full of good, ripe
bananas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began digging into his pockets. In the
end, he brought out three; quite a little feast.</p>
<p>After the first wild burst that came like a
flood, the rain settled down to a steady, monotonous
patter&mdash;patter&mdash;patter on the staunch canvas
roof.</p>
<p>Night crept in upon the world like the falling
of a great curtain. All three, Johnny, Doris and
Nieta had traveled far that day. They had been
hot. Now they were cool. They had been excited.
Now they were calm. They had been
weary. Now their bodies were in repose.</p>
<p>Slowly a drowsiness crept over them. The
slow patter&mdash;patter of rain on their roof, the low
rush of wind through the palms whispered of
sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>And why not? Just three winks. Here they
were cosy and safe. The storm would end. Then
they would wake to think of other things.</p>
<p>Perhaps they did not think it through in just
this manner. Probably they did not think it
through at all, but yielded to the call of slumber.
However that may be, time found them all
breathing softly and steadily in sleep. And still
the rain pattered on their canvas roof.</p>
<p>Just how long they slept no one will ever know.
It was Johnny who first awoke. He emerged
from unreality to reality, from dream life to real
life with something of a start.</p>
<p>In his dream he had once more followed the
strange monkey with the band of gold and a
diamond on his arm. The monkey climbed a
great cocoanut palm. With quite as much ability,
he followed after. Up&mdash;up&mdash;up, ten, twenty,
thirty, forty feet he climbed until at last he was
among the fronds, sitting on a clump of half-ripe
cocoanuts.</p>
<p>But where was the monkey? He looked wildly
about him and even as he looked a sudden burst
of wind seized the great palm and set it swaying
like an inverted pendulum, back and forth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>Still in the dream he threw out his hands&mdash;but
found nothing to which he might cling. He
tried to cry out but words stuck in his throat.</p>
<p>It was at this instant that he awoke. Awoke
to what? A very dark little chamber at the prow
of a sail-boat and silence.</p>
<p>No not quite silence. There was a strange
rushing sound all about him, and in the distance
an indistinct murmur of voices.</p>
<p>Instantly he recalled his position. But the
sounds, the rushing, the subdued voices, these
were startling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were no voices,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;No
people at all except&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps it was Doris and Nieta. They might
have awakened and gone out on deck.</p>
<p>But no, as his eyes became accustomed to the
dim light he made out their forms close beside
him. They were still asleep.</p>
<p>Then, of a sudden, he realized that a part of
his dream was true. The boat was pitching
about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are on the sea,&rdquo; he told himself as his
heart leaped painfully. &ldquo;They have launched
the boat, whoever they are. We are on our way
out to sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well,&rdquo; he endeavored to reassure himself,
&ldquo;they will be going to Cape Haitian. When we
get there, we will give them a grand surprise.
We&rsquo;ll crawl out and thank them for the ride.
What sport to be stowaways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But were they going to Cape Haitian?&rdquo; This
question troubled him more and more as time
went on. The size of the waves they rode, the
break of spray over the canvas, the creaking of
masts seemed to tell him that they were not hugging
the shore but striking boldly out to sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we are?&rdquo; Once more he caught his
breath. Where would they be going? What
was to be done when they got there? He had
never been on a tropical island save Haiti. What
the people were like on other islands he had not
the faintest notions. He had heard that some
were cannibals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>He thought of going on deck, of trying to hire
the skipper to carry them back to land. He
dared not. Perhaps these very people were cannibals
or pirates. Who could tell? All he could
do was to sit tight and see what happened. He
feared more for his recently found friends than
for himself.</p>
<p>As the boat sailed quietly on and nothing happened,
his mind became more at ease. He wondered
whether he should awaken his companions.
After a moment&rsquo;s thought he decided this would
be unwise. To awaken them would be to add to
their period of anxiety. Nothing could be done
until they came to some land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;wakened suddenly
from sleep, they may speak aloud and betray
our presence. That might bring disaster.
If these are bad men our chances of escape on
land will be much greater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he sat there in silent meditation, sensing
the lift and fall of the boat, catching the toss and
creak of the masts and wondering whither they
were bound.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, he thought again of the monkey
and his diamond set band of gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now surely,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;we will never
see him again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>Passing strange it was to be riding thus, alone
save for two sleeping companions; and those
friends for but an hour; sailing over waters he
had never before sailed to some land he had
never seen. The rain had ceased. The moon was
out. It shone upon a tossing sea.</p>
<p>More than four hundred years before another
small craft had sailed these waters in the light
of that moon. It was upon the shores of Haiti
that Columbus established his first colony. For
a time Johnny amused himself by imagining that
he was Columbus sitting in his berth, waiting for
the sound of a dropping anchor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been wonderful,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;The first white man to see these shores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of a sudden, as he sat there thinking, there
came a sharp command from the stern, then
another and yet another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely that must awaken them.&rdquo; He looked
at his companions as he stiffened in preparation
for an emergency.</p>
<p>Doris stirred but did not awaken. Nieta
slumbered on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>The boat gave a lurch, appeared to veer in its
course, then swept on. Ten minutes later the
tossing ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entered a bay. Come to land soon. What
land?&rdquo; He thrilled afresh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like the adventures of Robinson Crusoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour later the boat ground gently on
a sandy shore. The mast came down. There
was the sound of men going ashore. The boat
was drawn farther up on the beach. After that
all was darkness and silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now is our chance,&rdquo; he thought. His knees
trembled slightly as he rose to part the canvas
curtain and peer out.</p>
<p>He saw no living thing. Stepping boldly out
he looked shoreward. A grove of tall palms
painted a dark fringe against the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now is our chance,&rdquo; he repeated as he stepped
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doris.&rdquo; He spoke the name in a low tone as
he touched the girl&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;where are we?&rdquo; She sat up sleepily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where. I only know we have
arrived,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;Hurry. Waken that
native girl. We must get out of this boat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER XI
<br />THE DRUMS</h2>
<p>During the very hour in which Johnny
Thompson discovered that he and the two
girls, Doris and Nieta, were stowaways in a
strange schooner sailing straight out to sea, Curlie
Carson sat beside a mahogany table beneath
the stars in a beautiful tropical garden.</p>
<p>The air was heavy with the perfume of flowers.
The night was cool and damp. Now and then a
breeze from the distant sea set the palm fronds
rustling and brought forth a hoarse croak from
a sleeping buzzard.</p>
<p>Back of him was a home. And such a home as
it was! All white and glistening in the moonlight,
with its little spires and minarets, with its
broad, deep, mysterious windows, standing tall
against the dark green of palms it seemed some
castle in Spain&mdash;a thing of dreams.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>But the home, a sort of French Chateau, was
real. Haiti has thousands of beautiful homes.
Some of them hark back to the days when fine
French ladies rode out with their maids in the
cool of the evening, and a hundred thousand
slaves toiled in the sugar cane and the cotton.</p>
<p>The girl who sat opposite Curlie sipping limeade
was real too. To Curlie at first she had been
rather startling as well. She was Dot Montcalm,
Dorn&rsquo;s sister. To Curlie she was a great deal
more than that. She was the mysterious dark-haired
girl who had shared his adventure of the
night before. She it had been who had beaten
the strange native drum and had called together
that band of half wild natives to dance and to
plot revolution beneath the stars. She too had
raced away with him down the trail after the
weird howling of her dog had put the natives to
flight. All this she smilingly admitted on meeting
Curlie two hours before. He had not asked
her why she had concealed her identity. There
was no reason for asking. A girl with good sense,
and Dot Montcalm seemed well endowed with
that by nature, does not reveal her identity to a
stranger during a chance meeting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But she has told me nothing else,&rdquo; Curlie was
thinking to himself, as they sat there in the
garden before the girl&rsquo;s home. &ldquo;Why did she
beat out the drum signals that called that wild
band together to plot revolution. Surely she and
her father would be the last to desire a revolution.
In truth she seemed eager to scatter them
before plotting was begun. It&rsquo;s all very strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curlie had arrived at camp a little before noon
of that day. He had, as you well know, found
Johnny still missing. After visiting his laboratory
and finding all in order, he had heavily
bolted the door and then had announced his intention
of going to Dorn&rsquo;s village in search of
some clue of Johnny&rsquo;s whereabouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some natives may have seen him. He may
have arrived at the village over a strange trail,&rdquo;
he had said to Dorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dorn. &ldquo;That is true. You may
find him there. But as for Pompee and me, we
will remain. He may come here tired and hungry.
Besides,&rdquo; his eyes had gone dreamy, &ldquo;I
like this old Citadel. It is scary and most spooky
at night, but by day it is so old, so massive, so
grand. And then, at any moment I may come
upon one end of the &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo; sticking out
from the masonry. Then how rich we all shall
be.&rdquo; A low laugh followed this last remark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>So Curlie had gone away down the trail toward
the village of Terre Plaisance. And here
he was sitting across from Dot drinking limeade,
talking now and then of matters of no great consequence,
and dreaming long dreams in between.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A revolution,&rdquo; he thought now. &ldquo;How
wildly thrilling that would be. And yet it would
be tragic. These natives can&rsquo;t fight against our
airplanes, our gas, our machine guns. And
yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought of the long and bitter struggle that
had been going on in Nicaragua and of the war
between the invincible Napoleon and the Blacks
of Haiti and how the Blacks of Haiti had won.
After that he was not so sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must put an end to it,&rdquo; he said, speaking
aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what?&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the revolution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. We must. If we can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You do not want the revolution?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no! No!&rdquo; She shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you beat the drum. You called those
natives together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh that&mdash;why that was&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell
you about that sometime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time they sat there in silence. Then,
like the first flush of morning, her face lighted
with a smile. &ldquo;She will tell me,&rdquo; Curlie assured
himself.</p>
<p>But she did not, for at that precise moment
there came, faint, indistinct, like the low roll of
thunder, yet unmistakable a call from the distance
and the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The drums,&rdquo; a shudder ran through the girl&rsquo;s
slender form. &ldquo;Far away, the drums. And now
perhaps there will be a revolution. How&mdash;how
useless, how terrible! Someone must prevent it.
It can only end with the death of many honest
but deluded people; the poor, honest ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Mona the black servant who
had come to serve cocoa. &ldquo;It should not be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men all are gone; the native police too,&rdquo;
Dot said turning to Curlie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But we&mdash;we might do something,&rdquo; she added
after a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Curlie. &ldquo;We did something last
night. Plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you go with us?&rdquo; Dot turned to Mona.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I might help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might help a great deal. You know
all the secret mountain passes and the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; said the aged native woman. &ldquo;The
Blanc does much for my people. He is honest.
He will not do wrong. Rebellion is for bad men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Blanc&rdquo; is the Haitian&rsquo;s name for the
white man from America. In the few short
years of the American occupation the greater
part of the hill people of Haiti have come to trust
their American friends. Yet in every land there
is some discontent. There are some too who are
willing enough to stir up discontent that they
may advance their own selfish ends.</p>
<p>Even now, as they prepared to lose themselves
in the forest trails at night, Dot felt herself overtaken
with fear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Father has always said the hills are safe,&rdquo;
she said to Curlie. &ldquo;Yet there are many wild
rumors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take Leo,&rdquo; she continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a bow and arrows with me,&rdquo; said Curlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bow and arrows?&rdquo; exclaimed the girl in
great surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really a very strong one,&rdquo; said the boy.
&ldquo;A regular six foot yew bow. It will drive a
steel pointed arrow a full inch into a mahogany
tree. Johnny Thompson has been teaching me
to use it. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m getting pretty good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Curlie, &ldquo;we won&rsquo;t use it
to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Dot, not allowing him
to finish. &ldquo;But bring it. I only wish I could
shoot it. Just think of the lost arts there are in
the world! When Columbus was Governor of
this island every native knew how to shoot with
bows and strong ones, too. That was the way
they hunted and how they fought their battles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Curlie, &ldquo;we use them only
for sport now. But I&rsquo;ll take it along.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER XII
<br />CURLIE GETS THEIR GOAT</h2>
<p>You have not forgotten the strange plight
into which a jeweled monkey, a storm and
a strange craft had led Johnny and Doris. They
had arrived at night on some strange shore.
This must be an island. But what island and
how inhabited? Who could say? There were
questions enough in their minds but none were
asked as Doris and Nieta, in the prow of the
strange ship, following Johnny began feeling
their way out of the dark little forward cabin
into the moonlight.</p>
<p>As they stood upon the gunwale ready to drop
silently to the sandy beach, they saw circling to
the right and left of them a narrow bay. Back
from the beach was a fringe of palms.</p>
<p>The night was still. Only the faintest murmur
of wavelets lapping at the sand whispered
of the ocean&rsquo;s age-long unrest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>Back from the shore all seemed lost in slumber.
Not a light glimmered, not a camp fire glowed.
There was no sound. Even the soaring bats appeared
to have gone to rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;where are we?&rdquo; Doris shivered though
the night was not cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; In a few words Johnny told
all he knew of the night&rsquo;s curious adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All we can do,&rdquo; he said in conclusion, &ldquo;is to
find some sheltered spot where we can hide till
morning. Then I&rsquo;ll have to go out scouting to
discover if I can find what island this is and
what sort of people live upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as he spoke he was conscious of the fact
that he was reading into the present some of the
romance and adventure of the West Indies&rsquo;
colorful past. But for all that their position,
two girls and a boy on a strange shore at night,
was perilous enough.</p>
<p>Silently, in single file, they crossed the sandy
beach to come at last to the edge of the cocoanut
grove. There, by following the shore for a short
distance, they found a well trodden path leading
into the forest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t follow that, at least not to-night,&rdquo;
said Johnny. &ldquo;There are dogs, dangerous native
dogs. Natives always have them. And the natives&mdash;who
knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They continued along the beach until they
came to a spot where the land rose quite abruptly
up from the sea.</p>
<p>There they found a second trail, little more
than a wild animal&rsquo;s trail to water. The tracks
they found there were the sharply cut marks of
goats&rsquo; hoofs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go up here,&rdquo; said Johnny leading the
way. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get up high where there are no
mosquitoes. There we can rest and think things
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour later they found themselves seated
upon a mossy bank beneath low-growing palms.
The night was soon to end. Then would come
morning. What of that morning? Who could
answer?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>As Johnny sat there listening for some sound
that might spell danger, trying at times to peer
into the darkness, his mind was filled with many
strange thoughts. At times he found himself
wondering about the secret Curlie Carson had
hidden away in his laboratory up there in the
Citadel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s something like my old pal, Panther
Eye,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Always working something
out, springing some surprise; always mysterious.
Wonder where old Pant is now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought of the &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo;. &ldquo;Guess
we&rsquo;ll never find it,&rdquo; he told himself gloomily.
&ldquo;Never can tell, though. One thing&rsquo;s sure&mdash;never
will find it by chasing jeweled monkeys and
getting caught out all times night and day on
boats and islands with a pair of girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t be sure he regretted his latest experience.
Doris was a regular sport. He liked
her. Hadn&rsquo;t made the least fuss when she found
herself marooned on a strange island. &ldquo;Be a
great joke if she and this native girl really followed
up that jeweled monkey and found the
black queen&rsquo;s treasure and we never as much as
had a look at the &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo;. Things come
out that way sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>He thought of the natives who tried to kidnap
him. &ldquo;Something strange about that,&rdquo; he
thought. They had not laid a hand on him from
first to last. He wondered what would have
happened if he had really resisted. As it was he
had walked out on them and they were quite
powerless to stop him. He wished now that he
had seen the thing through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way with life,&rdquo; he whispered to
the darkness. &ldquo;We have a feeling that life is
short, that we must hurry here, hurry there, get
out of this and into that; that we really haven&rsquo;t
time to see things through. And the joke of it
all is life is very, very long and we&rsquo;ve time for
almost everything, plenty of time if only we
think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">In the meantime Dorn, with old Pompee at
his side at the camp by the Citadel, watched and
waited for Johnny&rsquo;s return. At times he wondered
if Doris and Nieta had found their way
safely home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they did,&rdquo; he said aloud once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did what?&rdquo; Pompee asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did find their way home. The girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. To be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>Had he seen what at that moment was happening
at his home he would have been not a little
startled. Curlie Carson, Dot and the aged native
woman were at the gate prepared to follow
the sound of the drums in search of the secret
meeting of the would-be rebels, when there
sounded on the flagstone walk outside the rattle
of a donkey&rsquo;s hoofs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Doris,&rdquo; Dot exclaimed. &ldquo;Doris and
Nieta. I am glad. We have been worried about
them. Of course, we thought they might have
stayed at your camp two nights, but that they
did not intend to do. The storm must have delayed
them. But now here they are. They&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;what?&rdquo; She stared as the donkey
came into view. His baskets were empty. He
was riderless and alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can have happened?&rdquo; She looked at
Curlie as if expecting an answer. But Curlie
had no answer for her. When he had reached
his camp that day the girls were already gone.
This he told her in the kindliest tone he knew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>At once there was commotion in the household.
Doris and Nieta were lost; lost alone in the night
and the jungle, perhaps kidnapped, robbed,
killed. Who could say? Curlie thought of
Johnny&rsquo;s disappearance and of the strange camp
on the mountain; thought too of the plotted rebellion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can do nothing to-night,&rdquo; said Dot. &ldquo;We
must be up and away on the search at dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime?&rdquo; said Curlie.</p>
<p>As if in answer to his question, to their ears
there came once more the distant tum&mdash;tum&mdash;tum
of native drums.</p>
<p>Curlie looked at Dot. Dot looked at her aged
servant. Then, without a word they walked out
of the gate bound for the hills, the three of them,
ready to follow the sound of the drums, ready
for any peril or adventure to which this might
lead.</p>
<p>It was strange, this marching up a little known
trail in the night, following the sound of the
drum that grew louder, ever louder as they advanced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>The night was strange too. The moist air
laden with the odor of blossoms and tropical
spices was a constant delight. The stars shone
as no stars had ever shone before. Here some
creeping thing set the dry leaves rustling, there
a strange bird piped his shrill night tune.</p>
<p>The trail was steep. As they paused beside a
massive rock a breath of wind came sweeping up
from the sea to fan their cheeks. Then, quite
unexpectedly Dot&rsquo;s heart gave a leap. From up
the trail came a sound as of a host rushing
through the brush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;Ah!&rdquo; she whispered sibilantly, gripping
Curlie&rsquo;s arm and backing into the brush.</p>
<p>Curlie began to laugh. &ldquo;Do you not recognize
the sound?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a &lsquo;chattering
woman&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, yes, so it is a &lsquo;chattering woman&rsquo;. How
stupid of me to get all excited,&rdquo; she exclaimed
as she stared away in the direction of the curious
tree.</p>
<p>Dot told herself that she must get better control
of her nerves if she was to be of any service
on this strange enterprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! The dance grows wilder,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;If we are to learn anything, be of any service,
we must hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she explained as they moved steadily
up the trail, &ldquo;the United States Government
is doing all it can for this republic, especially
for the common people, who most of all appreciate
and deserve it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a few in the cities, who were used
to growing fat on graft under the old rule, who
do not like the Americans. Then too there are
traders, white men with black hearts, who will
do anything they can to stir up trouble. In the
old days they grew rich selling arms and supplies
to rebels. It is rumored that a boat loaded
with rifles and ammunition is hiding away somewhere
among the islands and that a rebel chieftain
is here in the hills exciting the hill people
to rebel. If only the Marines were here and the
native police,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;they&rsquo;d put an end to
it. But we must do what we can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If rebellion is started, cruel leaders will go
roving through the hills forcing the people to
follow them. In that way many innocent ones
will be killed. If it can only be stopped, lives
will be saved. And think what it means to live!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>Curlie did think. Every morning was a delight.
Every day brought some fresh revelation
from the natural world. Each night brought
sweet repose. Ah yes, life was good.</p>
<p>The life of the hill people was simple and
beautiful&mdash;children playing about their small,
grass thatched, white plastered homes, men hoeing
corn, women picking wild coffee, and always
the simple songs of the hills were on their lips.</p>
<p>As they rounded a rugged cliff that overhung
the trail, the sound of the drums grew louder and
mingled with it was the chant of many voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very near,&rdquo; said the native woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said Curlie impressively. &ldquo;When
Columbus visited this island on his first great
voyage, he heard those drums. All down the
centuries they have sounded until now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dot. &ldquo;And always for war. If
only we could get their goat,&rdquo; she said once more.
&ldquo;They will not go into revolt before the black
goat is sacrificed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t get their goat,&rdquo; Mona whispered
in an awed tone. &ldquo;The <i>Papa Lou</i> has
thrown a spell about the black goat. He throws
spells over men and all living things. If he says
&lsquo;come&rsquo; the nightingale lights on his shoulder and
the wild parrot eats from his hands. Twenty
days ago the black goat ran wild in the mountains.
Now he will not leave the <i>Papa Lou</i>. You
do what you will, you cannot get the black goat.
It is a spell that is cast over him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some part of what you have said is true,&rdquo;
said Dot, &ldquo;but not all, I hope. We can get their
goat. At least I hope so. Somehow we must do
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that they began moving forward, now bending
low to glide along on tiptoe, and now creeping
on hands and knees toward their strange
goal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There they are!&rdquo; Mona whispered,
as she at last parted two broad palm leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there! There is the black goat!&rdquo; Dot
breathed. &ldquo;And see!&rdquo; Her words came in an
excited whisper. &ldquo;See! There is no spell upon
him. He is tied with a slender rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone else has done this,&rdquo; the aged native
woman&rsquo;s tone was one of calm assurance. &ldquo;The
<i>Papa Lou</i> did not tie him. There is no need.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we could but get the goat!&rdquo; Dot whispered
once more. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; her low whispered
tones were tense with suppressed excitement,
&ldquo;these voodoo people have always been great believers
in sacrifice. They have even been accused
of human sacrifice, but this I cannot believe to
be true. However that may be, they have always
sacrificed animals. The goat, a black goat with
not a white hair, has always been their choice,
yet, when Christophe prepared to defend his people
against the French, he and his followers
pledged themselves to fight until death over the
carcass of a freshly killed wild boar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black goats are rare. This <i>Papa Lou</i>, by
some chance, has found one running wild in the
mountains. He captured it. They have it now,
as you see. After the drumming, dancing and
singing will come the ceremony of sacrifice. And
after that will begin&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The revolution,&rdquo; Curlie whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The revolution,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;And our
little village may be attacked and destroyed at
once. For we are white and there are few to
protect us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>In his mind&rsquo;s eye Curlie saw the beautiful
white chateau standing out like a castle of Spain
in the moonlight. He pictured himself once
more in that beautiful garden with this splendid
girl pal across from him and thereupon resolved
that, come what might, all this beauty and happiness
must not be destroyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;We must get their
goat to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But how was this to be done? The goat stood
at a spot not five feet from the edge of the circling
throng. The flare of the camp fire lighted the
scene. To approach near enough to free the goat
was to court disaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen.&rdquo; Dot held up a hand.</p>
<p>The drumming had ceased quite suddenly.
The chanting died away. Exhausted dancers
threw themselves upon the grass. A dark figure,
a man unmistakably from the city, a black man
with an evil face, rose up from among the people.
He began to speak in French creole, the language
of the people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>For a time the three there in the shadows
listened spell-bound. The man&rsquo;s words came
forth in wild explosive outbursts. The people
murmured assent, or sat in stolid silence, listening
to the harangue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he say?&rdquo; Curlie whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He,&rdquo; Mona answered, &ldquo;he say what is not
true. But how are these simple ones to know?
He say white men have come to enslave us, even
as French men enslaved our grandfathers. Already
we work roads we do not travel. Time
will come when we work on plantations, in sugar
mills, in mines and have no pay. That he says.
Better he says that we die fighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People have worked the roads always,&rdquo; said
Dot. &ldquo;Now they work on the most needed roads.
It&rsquo;s part of America&rsquo;s efficiency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Mona. &ldquo;But how can these
understand? After the speech&mdash;the sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curlie repeated, &ldquo;We must get the goat. But
how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought of his bow and arrow. He was
a fair shot. The arrow point was sharp as a
razor blade. One twang of the bow, one wild
bleat, perhaps, and the goat would be no more.
Yet he shrank from killing such a beautiful
creature. Besides, such a course was fraught
with danger. They might be caught. There must
be another way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>And then like a flash, to his mind came a suggestion
of a possible way out. At once he began
groping about on the ground and about the bark
of the ancient tree that spread its protecting
branches above them. It was a pine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said Mona. &ldquo;He is telling them that
a boat load of arms and ammunition awaits them
in Deception Bay. After the sacrifice&mdash;the rebellion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get their goat,&rdquo; whispered Curlie.
He was smearing his arrowhead with a sticky
substance. &ldquo;Now!&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;Now!&rdquo; He
nocked his arrow. Then, with a whispered word
he thrust something into Dot&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a match,&rdquo; his whisper was low. &ldquo;A sulphur
match. Strike it and apply it to the head
of my arrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A small blue flame appeared. It wavered for
a second at the arrow&rsquo;s head. A larger golden
flame replaced it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>The next instant that yellow flame shot forward
to lodge in the bark of the pine tree to
which the goat was tied. It was a perfect shot.
The flames of burning rosin were licking their
way toward the rope that held the goat captive.</p>
<p>Mona stared with all her eyes. The tiny
golden flame had not been noted by the throng.
They were too intent on their leader&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>The arrow and the pine rosin flame burned
fiercely now. The rope was already singed. In
ten seconds it would be burned away. The goat&rsquo;s
keen senses warned him of fire. He strained at
his rope. One second, two, three, five, then with a
wild <i>blaa</i>&mdash;he threw his full force into one terrific
tug. It was enough. The rope gave way.
He fell. Rolling over and over, he at last
scrambled to his feet and with a final <i>blaa</i> dashed
away into the darkness that was the jungle.</p>
<p>For a space of ten seconds there was silence.
Then pandemonium broke loose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The goat! The goat! The black goat!&rdquo; the
natives screamed in a chorus.</p>
<p>Then, with one accord, they went dashing
away into the night, in a wild but futile attempt
to recapture the goat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The goat,&rdquo; said Dot, rising from among the
ferns, &ldquo;is free. And Mona,&rdquo; she said quietly,
&ldquo;there was no spell woven about him. The moment
his bonds were burned away he ran into
the forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no spell,&rdquo; said Mona.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no revolution now,&rdquo; said Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at once,&rdquo; said Mona. Then as if a new
thought had come to her, &ldquo;There is a great white
shadow in the sea at Deception Bay. That is
where the ship with rifles is hiding. They had
better be careful. The great white shadow&mdash;he
makes men disappear. They never come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Dot to Curlie in a tone so low the
aged native woman could not hear, &ldquo;is another
of her wild Voodoo notions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made their way unmolested down the
mountainside. In time, after a long march, they
entered the sleeping village. Once more, as Curlie&rsquo;s
eyes took in the beauty of it all, the few
white chateaux, the many modest homes of the
natives, he said with increasing conviction, &ldquo;It
must not be destroyed by a revolution. It must
not!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>When they had entered the garden of the
chateau, Dot put out a cool hand and gave Curlie
a strong handclasp and a good night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, in a tone that was deeply
serious. &ldquo;We have had two adventures. Something
tells me the third will come very soon.
Where there are two there are always three.
You will not forget?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not forget,&rdquo; said Curlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May you sleep well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweet dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was gone. The room that had been assigned
to Curlie was on the ground floor. The
door opened on the broad porch. He was free to
come and go as he chose. Because the night had
been an exciting one and his blood was not yet
cooled for sleep, he decided to take a turn about
the village streets. In this way he chanced upon
a man who was destined to play a large part in
the near future, not alone of himself but of his
friend Johnny Thompson as well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>The man was standing before a low door over
which a feeble kerosene lamp burned. Curlie
recognized him at once. True he had never seen
him, but he fitted so well the description of the
short, broad man who had played the good
Samaritan to Johnny when he fell among the
wild natives on the road to the Citadel that there
could be no mistaking his identity.</p>
<p>Strangely enough the man recognized Curlie
Carson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are one of the young men from up at the
Citadel,&rdquo; he said without waiting to be spoken
to. &ldquo;You are looking for the &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo;.
What strange fancy tells you it is there? And
where is your companion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to know that last myself,&rdquo; said
Curlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you might,&rdquo; said the short, broad
man, blinking his eyes in a strange way. &ldquo;Well,
I can tell you this much: he left some native
friends, left them flat when they were bent on
doing him a good turn, a very good turn. Left
them flat I tell you. Walked right out on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curlie was astonished at the man&rsquo;s talk. How,
he wondered, could the man know so much about
Johnny?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know a great deal,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Perhaps
you can tell me where he is now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;I can not. If he is
lost, it is his own fault. The natives would have
guided him safely back to the Citadel and perhaps
he would have brought back with him that
which he could not have carried, though I dare
say he is a very strong boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s talk got Curlie in more and more
of a tangle. He had assumed that Johnny had
been kidnapped. But here was a man saying the
natives were his friends bent on loading him
down with presents he could not carry alone.</p>
<p>All this was too much for Curlie&rsquo;s weary mind
to grasp. In an effort to think it through, he
looked down at his feet. When he looked up
once more, the short, broad man was gone. He
had vanished into the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br />CHAPTER XIII
<br />CRUSOES FOR A NIGHT</h2>
<p>As the three companions, Johnny, Doris and
Nieta sat upon the mossy bank beneath the
palms waiting for the dawn on that mysterious
island. Johnny was not the only one to indulge
in long, long thoughts. Doris came in for her
full share.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; she told herself, as a little thrill
ran through her, &ldquo;to be camping here on an island
we have never seen. Who can say what
wild creatures may roam these forests? Time
was when whole herds of wild cattle wandered
peacefully over our own dry plains or went
charging madly up the steep slopes to escape
some pursuer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>As she sat there amid the silence, she fancied
all manner of strange and unusual things, yet a
stout heart held her nerves steady. Fortunately
her mind was fresh. Sleep on the boat had done
much for her. She was ready for another day
and whatever it might bring. So she sat there
listening to the voice of the jungle.</p>
<p>Night brings its changes to a tropical island.
At night a thousand creatures, too torpid or too
timid to face the light of day, fare forth in
search of food. Strange mouselike rodents, and
those resembling rabbits, sport in the spots where
moonlight falls. The short-nosed wild pig comes
forth from his dark retreat to root around among
the ferns and shrubs. More fearsome creatures
there are too: yellow snakes and great, brown
lizards.</p>
<p>All this Doris knew, yet, strangely enough,
she experienced no tremor of fear. Not so
strange after all perhaps: for was not Johnny
Thompson close at hand? It is strange this confidence
of a girl in the strength of a boy; her
utter confidence in his power to defend her from
the beasts of the jungle, from a hidden enemy,
yes, from the very lightning bolts that shoot
from the sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>Perhaps, as she sat there, eyes half closed, part
asleep, part awake, the girl dreamed of the time
when she should have a man who was all her own,
and a home. For, long ago she had learned that
the best of life&rsquo;s good things come to those who
have a roof, a kitchen, a hearthfire they can call
their own.</p>
<p>She thought for the hundredth time of the
jeweled monkey and of the treasure supposed to
be hidden away in the now ruined castle. She
thought of Johnny&rsquo;s &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo; and wondered
if it had really existed, existed still to-day
or were made of the stuff that dreams are woven
from.</p>
<p>She thrilled as she recalled Johnny&rsquo;s story of
the copper-colored natives and his battle with the
wild boar.</p>
<p>Most of all she wondered about the island
which they had reached in such a strange manner.
Was it a small island? Was it large?
Were there many natives? Were they wild natives?
Was it true that some of these natives
were cannibals? It had been true long ago in
the days of Columbus. Had they changed or
had they clung to their primitive customs down
the long centuries? She thought of Nieta and
her snake-tooth charm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If she who has lived among white people all
her life still believes in this Voodoo charm,&rdquo; she
thought with a shudder, &ldquo;what is one to expect
from the inhabitants of some small island where
the white man is seldom seen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she wondered and thought, and wondered
again until the first flush of dawn came sifting
down among the trees. Then Johnny Thompson
rose to shake himself and peer into the dawn.
After that they started, the three of them,
through that faint but beautiful light that is a
tropical morning, toward the beach, fortified with
brave hearts, strong bodies and clean minds
against that which the day might bring forth.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>At that very hour Curlie and Dot were leaving
the garden of the chateau. They were going in
search of Doris and Nieta. Dot&rsquo;s father was
away. There remained at their home only two
aged servants. Because of the threatened revolution
it was necessary that the servants remain
and keep a sharp watch out for trouble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Father should be told of the revolution,&rdquo; said
Dot. &ldquo;He should know, too, that Doris has disappeared.
But who will find him? He is to be
gone for a week. He will travel from place to
place and has no definite route.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s up to us to do
what is to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count on me,&rdquo; said Curlie. &ldquo;Mike and I
will help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mike?&rdquo; The girl threw him a curious
glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why yes,&mdash;Mike.&rdquo; Curlie spoke slowly as
if reluctant to say more.</p>
<p>With a girl&rsquo;s quick perception, she read his
thoughts and asked no other questions.</p>
<p>So in the half darkness of early morning, they
left the beautiful chateau to lose themselves on
the jungle trail that leads up to the ancient fortress
where Dorn, after a restless night full of
dire forebodings, was doing his bit helping old
Pompee kindle a fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>They walked along in silence, Curlie and the
girl. Curlie was thinking. He had always
thought of Haiti as a quiet place, sleepy and hot
where nothing truly exciting ever happened, yet
after being here only part of a very short summer,
he found himself facing many mysteries
and, as far as he could tell, in for more than one
adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only people wouldn&rsquo;t be forever getting
themselves lost,&rdquo; he thought to himself.</p>
<p>His mind at that moment was busy with
thoughts of his little laboratory at the ancient
Citadel. &ldquo;If only they&rsquo;d leave me alone I&rsquo;d get
the thing completed. And it is important that I
should complete it; especially if there is to be a
revolution. With these superstitious natives&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man! Oh Man!&rdquo; He unconsciously spoke
out loud. &ldquo;How they would run!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who would run?&rdquo; said Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;why the natives, of course. They&rsquo;re
always running, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the girl understood and said no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a peach of a girl. Don&rsquo;t insist on prying
into everything,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Someday I&rsquo;ll
tell her my secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this Midas were only a dog,&rdquo; he said a
moment later, speaking of Dot&rsquo;s donkey, &ldquo;he
could lead us back over the trail to his mistress.
But being only a donkey&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Midas has donkey&rsquo;s ears because he is a donkey.&rdquo;
The girl laughed a merry laugh. &ldquo;Since
he is a donkey you can&rsquo;t expect too much of him.
But we&rsquo;ll find Doris all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it,&rdquo; said Curlie.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>In the meantime Johnny, Doris and Nieta had
reached the beach and were revelling in a tropical
sunrise over the sea.</p>
<p>Dawn on a tropical sea! How can one describe
it? Great, dark clouds that appear to
threaten sudden disaster. The sea a sheet of
gray steel. Then, slowly comes the change. The
dull, threatening clouds are tinted with the pink
of rose petals. The sea loses its dull foreboding
and like the sky becomes a thing of beauty.
Brighter colors follow, red, orange, yellow, and
after that, with a low whisper of wavelets the day
is ushered in.</p>
<p>And such a day as it promised to be for the
three of them, Johnny, Doris and Nieta.</p>
<p>The first fact that Johnny&rsquo;s practiced eye noted
was that the boat that had carried them to these
strange shores was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What if this should prove to be a small,
abandoned island,&rdquo; he said aloud, &ldquo;like Robinson
Crusoe&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if it should?&rdquo; Doris breathed.</p>
<p>What indeed? They were young, romantic.
The sea lay before them. Behind them was the
island. The thrilling possibilities of it all set
their blood racing. Animal trails no human
foot has trod. Jungles no man has explored.
Strange butterflies and flowers of a species no man
has known. Ruins perhaps of a long forgotten
race or of some ancient pirate&rsquo;s hiding place. All
these possibilities and more lay before them.</p>
<p>There was food. Wild bananas, cocoanuts,
bread fruit, fish in the streams and the sea, and
birds so tame they might almost be caught with
the naked hand.</p>
<p>As they stood there day-dreaming, the sea, the
air, the very palm tops appeared to listen to their
thoughts; so calm and still it was; such a Sabbath
hush there was over all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>And then, crashing into their thoughts, wrecking
the silence, came a laugh, the loud, prolonged
laugh of a black man. There could be no mistaking
it. No white man, certainly no Oriental,
could laugh like that.</p>
<p>The boy and girl started, then stood for ten
seconds looking into one another&rsquo;s eyes. After
that, because the laugh was contagious, they too
burst forth into merry peals of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are people on the island,&rdquo; said Johnny.
&ldquo;A man seldom laughs when he is alone. Never
like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; said Doris, &ldquo;do cannibals and pirates
laugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;Surely not that
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange it is,&rdquo; he said after a moment
of silence. &ldquo;Men may read your character, your
mood, your very attitude toward life and your
fellow men by your laugh. A boy torments a
smaller boy by burning his bare foot with a hot
stick. He laughs. How different is that laugh
from a heart so full of pure joy that it needs
must overflow with laughter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are people over there,&rdquo; he repeated.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use prolonging the suspense. Either
they are friendly natives or vicious savages. In
either case there is nothing gained by delay.
Humanity is very much the same everywhere.
We are usurpers in their land. The best we can
do is to march right up and say, &lsquo;Howdy&rsquo;. Let&rsquo;s
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And away they marched.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><br />CHAPTER XIV
<br />THE MARINE KING</h2>
<p>Of all the strange sights their heightened
imaginations prepared them to behold,
none, perhaps, could have so filled the minds of
Doris and Johnny with astonishment as that
which they saw when, having passed a grove of
cocoanuts and a clump of low growing palms,
they came to a broad clearing.</p>
<p>Before them was a circle of hard trodden
sand. Standing there were more than a hundred
natives.</p>
<p>In the center, and to all appearances king of
them all, was a man seated upon a throne of
hand-hewn mahogany. On the head of this man
was a battered crown and in his hand an ebony
stick, which one might assume was used as a
scepter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>Most astonishing of all was the fact that the
man was neither black nor brown, but white.
And he was dressed in the olive drab uniform of
an American Marine.</p>
<p>For one full moment they stood there, the boy
and the two girls, unobserved, staring at this astounding
revelation. Their reactions to the
scene were strange. Johnny was scarcely able to
resist a desire to laugh. Doris stood stock still,
lips parted, pupils dilated, staring. Nieta felt an
all but overpowering desire to turn and flee.</p>
<p>Then something happened. The strange king,
on his stranger throne, turned his crowned head
and looked squarely at them.</p>
<p>This apparently was his turn to stare and stare
he did in quite an unroyal manner.</p>
<p>Another moment had elapsed by the time he
regained his composure sufficiently to find his
tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why hello there!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Who are
you and where did you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who are you?&rdquo; It was Doris who
asked this without answering his question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; His face expanded into a
broad grin. &ldquo;I am the Marine King of Manowa.
And these,&rdquo; he added with a low bow, &ldquo;are my
subjects&mdash;some of &rsquo;em. Three thousand, in all,
and pretty loyal, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; Doris told herself, rubbing a hand
across her eyes, as if to dispel a vision, &ldquo;is not
reality. It is a chapter from Alice in Wonderland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was not. The Marine King of Manowa
proved to be very real indeed. The repast he
spread before his three young guests a half hour
later dispelled the last doubt. One doesn&rsquo;t get
real oatmeal with rich cream, poached eggs and
hot cakes with honey from the pages of a fairy
book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is real,&rdquo; Doris whispered to Johnny.
&ldquo;But how strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you think it&rsquo;s awfully queer,&rdquo; said
the Corporal King, polishing his battered crown
thoughtfully, &ldquo;that I should be king over here.
Well, it&rsquo;s a strange sort of a yarn.&rdquo; He settled
back in his rustic seat. &ldquo;You see, this island is
part of Haiti, and our country, the grand old
United States of America, is engaged at present
in an endeavor to bring order out of chaos.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Doris eagerly. &ldquo;My uncle is a
horticultural expert. He&rsquo;s trying to help them
to raise fruits and nuts in a better way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;is part of the work, a
mighty important part, too. If you are to have
schools, hospitals and all that, you must have
money to support &rsquo;em. And rocks, big round
silver washers I mean, comes from what you sell.
But first of all,&rdquo; he grinned a good-natured grin,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve gotta sort of knock their thick heads together
an&rsquo; git &rsquo;em to be good. And that&rsquo;s no job
fer a Y. M. C. A. secretary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Marine, and Marines, so they say, are
hard-boiled&mdash;tough as old sole leather baked in
the sun. They put me here with twelve rough
and readys and said, &lsquo;Make &rsquo;em be good&rsquo;. That
was my job. I&rsquo;d of liked somethin&rsquo; else but
Marines have to take what they get&mdash;and be
happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right off I discovered that there was two of
these Christophes wantin&rsquo; to wear this brass ring
on his old bean and neither one succeedin&rsquo; more
than a day at a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did I do? What would you have
done?&rdquo; He turned to Johnny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why I,&mdash;er,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d a done what I done,&rdquo; replied the king
with a hoarse laugh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d a said, &lsquo;Here, gimme
the thing. I&rsquo;ll wear it.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what I done
and it worked; worked mighty well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no great amount of education. Don&rsquo;t
take a college professor to see that. But I believe
in it&mdash;education I mean. If I can get
enough high hatters to teach &rsquo;em and enough
money I&rsquo;ll have the best educated little kingdom
this side of the Golden Gates. We&rsquo;ve no school
at all yet. We&rsquo;ll have one though. You&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this crown was set with diamonds,&rdquo; he said,
thumbing the spots where diamonds might once
have been, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d take them out and sell them for
money to buy a school house. For a school house
is more important than diamonds or Persian rugs
or anything like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know where there is one diamond,&rdquo; said
Doris impulsively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, several of them,&rdquo; smiled the king.
&ldquo;Trouble is, folks won&rsquo;t sell their diamonds to
help me build my school.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But this one does not belong to anyone: at
least a&mdash;a monkey has it and a monkey isn&rsquo;t anyone,
is he?&rdquo; Doris blushed in her excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the king with a laugh. &ldquo;Not that
I know of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then of course the story of the jeweled monkey
had to be told.</p>
<p>When the story was finished the king sat for
a long time in a brown study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he exclaimed at last, &ldquo;it sounds
wild, but there are a great many stories&mdash;most of
them wild tales I guess&mdash;about the treasure
hidden by old Emperor Christophe before his
reign was brought to a close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know there was a heap of gold then and
a barrel of jewels. What became of them? Who
knows? What if this monkey has discovered the
hidin&rsquo; place of that wealth? You might follow
him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And find all the hidden treasure,&rdquo; Doris
broke in excitedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; smiled the king. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll probably
never see that monkey again. And yet, it&rsquo;s
strange what things happen. Take your landin&rsquo;
on this island. You might have landed anywhere
else and been lost from your family for
days and days. But now, if you are brave
enough, you&rsquo;ll be at home in less than three
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three! Three hours!&rdquo; they cried excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Less time perhaps. By airplane. My supply
plane will be here within an hour. Then, if
you&rsquo;ve got the nerve, you can go flyin&rsquo; straight
back to Cape Haitian. Do you dare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we dare?&rdquo; Doris leaped to her feet to
do a wild fling across the sand. &ldquo;Dare? Dare?&rdquo;
she cried again. &ldquo;Who wouldn&rsquo;t dare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for the native girl, Nieta, she whispered to
her snake-tooth charm, then said to Doris with a
very sober face, &ldquo;I am very much afraid, but I
will go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never, as long as she lives, will Doris forget
that ride back to Cape Haitian. There was a
friendly handclasp and a &ldquo;May you come back&rdquo;
from the king and they were away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>Up, up, up they climbed. The sea swam beneath
them. The little island of Manowa
drifted away behind them. The great island of
Haiti with its plains, its forests, its cloud-capped
mountains reached out friendly hands to greet
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How wonderful are all the inventions of our
age!&rdquo; Doris thought. &ldquo;What a marvelous privilege
to live in such an age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still, like some great bird their plane soared
aloft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><br />CHAPTER XV
<br />DREAMS</h2>
<p>Before they began this thrilling flight
Doris and Nieta had told their pilot the
exact location of their home in the village of
Terre Plaisance. Cape Haitian, his own headquarters,
was some twenty miles from their home.
This distance they had expected to cover on donkeyback
or on foot, as circumstance permitted.
Imagine their surprise when, as they watched
the ever changing panorama that passed beneath
them, they began recognizing little hill peaks
and dark groves that formed the surroundings
of their own little village and not Cape Haitian
at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; Doris said to herself, with a little
intake of breath, &ldquo;he would not attempt to land
in our garden, or the village street. That would
be impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>As for Nieta she was busy whispering to her
snake-tooth charm, for she expected nothing else
than that they would go crashing into some rocky
hillside or plunging into the forest.</p>
<p>The plane circled once. It circled again, this
time much lower. A third time they circled, so
low that Doris could count the tiny flower beds
in the garden. For a half minute she held her
breath, then like some wild fowl that circling
has failed to find water, the plane shot upward
and away.</p>
<p>Curlie Carson and Dot heard the drumming
of the plane and wondered at its presence there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never seen a plane here before,&rdquo; said
Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Curlie, &ldquo;they have had some
word of the revolution that is brewing and are
on the lookout for the rebel camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; said Dot. &ldquo;I&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look!&rdquo; she broke short off to stand staring.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming down. They&mdash;they&rsquo;ll
crash!&rdquo; She put both hands over her eyes to shut
out the sight. But of this there was no need, for
the plane disappeared silently behind the distant
treetops.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; said Curlie, seizing her by the
hand and dragging her down the trail. &ldquo;They
can&rsquo;t be far away. They may be injured&mdash;dying.
The plane may be on fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then madly, recklessly, heedless of bruises
and scratches, they went racing, scrambling,
rolling, tumbling down the hillside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we must be half way there,&rdquo; Curlie
said, panting.</p>
<p>Again he paused to puff. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be far now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Imagine their surprise when, as they parted
the branches of a low palm tree, they came upon
an open, uncultivated field and saw in the midst
of that field an airplane resting safely upon its
landing wheels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all things!&rdquo; said Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there are girls,&rdquo; said Curlie. &ldquo;Two of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Dot, sitting down upon the
ground with alarming suddenness, &ldquo;is Doris and
Nieta. Nice trick they played on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of them but never met them,&rdquo; said
Curlie, offering the girl his hand. &ldquo;Suppose you
take me over and give me an introduction.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>A half hour later, after many a laugh and
much introducing and explaining, when the gallant
young pilot had flown away the four young
people, Doris, Dot, Johnny and Curlie, marched
away toward the village of Terre Plaisance,
which was now but a comfortable walking distance
away.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>&ldquo;Curlie,&rdquo; said Johnny, late that night, as they
sat with their feet on a broad window sill, looking
through a great window to a scene of matchless
beauty, tropical flowers, waving fronds and
a sky sprinkled with stars, &ldquo;Curlie, old boy, a
fellow could almost settle down to something like
this. I&rsquo;ve never seen anything quite like it, have
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Curlie, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve been in the
northern wilds. Too cold up there. I&rsquo;ve seen
the Amazon country. Too hot. Too humid.
Too many bugs. But here&mdash;look out there.
Sense it all, the night, the perfume of flowers,
the stars.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>Perhaps they thought too of the girls who had
left them but a short half hour before. Their
dresses that night had formed a strange contrast
to that worn in the bush. Khaki had been replaced
by filmy things of brilliant color. Doris
had been dressed in pink and old rose; Dot in
dark blue and a glorious orange hue. Together
they had played low, haunting native airs on
banjo and ukulele, while the palms accompanied
them with the ever restless rustle of the mysterious
jungle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Curlie, &ldquo;we could almost do it, but
not quite. Only one thing keeps us from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The existence of a mystery yet unsolved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;many mysteries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; Curlie yawned, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d better turn
in, for to-morrow is another day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><br />CHAPTER XVI
<br />THE CALL OF THE DRUMS</h2>
<p>Again it was night. Once more the moon
edged the crest of the ancient Citadel with
a line of silver. Curlie and Johnny had returned
to camp. They were welcomed by Dorn with
shouts of joy. Old Pompee had uttered grunts
of satisfaction and had begun at once the beating
up of sorghum seed into petit meal, which later
would be formed into cakes and baked on hot
coals.</p>
<p>The boys arrived too late for any daylight exploration
of the Citadel. After an hour of rest
followed by a sumptuous meal of hot cakes and
roasted wild pig, they went each his own way in
search of adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>Curlie struck away up the Citadel trail that
led to his laboratory. There, finding all in order,
he began work on wires, switches and batteries.
From time to time a low tum&mdash;tum&mdash;tum came
from one or the other of his two native drums.
At other times there sounded a shrill piping not
unlike the notes of a boy&rsquo;s willow whistle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Johnny was pursuing an investigation
of his own. Recalling the story of the
ancient black emperor&rsquo;s visits to the Citadel and
the story of how he went to the crest of the uncompleted
fortress to work all night long with
mortar and stone, he had thought too of the slaves
who, looking up from their hard beds of trodden
earth, had seen him working there. From all
this he had developed a theory which he hoped
might aid him in discovering the spot, or at
least the general location on the wall where
Christophe had worked at night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he told himself as he stood upon a
certain raised portion of earth, &ldquo;those slaves
could not have slept. The space is too narrow
and irregular. There were many hundreds of
workmen. The greater part of them were slaves
condemned to toil on the wall. They must be
kept together, guarded against escape at night.
Must have been a broad, clear, open space.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>After wandering about, flashing his light far
and near, walking here, turning to the right,
then to the left he came to a definite conclusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This broad square,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;must
have been the sleeping ground of the workers.
And from this point only a small section of the
wall may be seen, not more than a fourth of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of a sudden, he started. It came to him with
something of a shock that this very section of the
wall might be seen plainly from their own camp.
Dorn and Pompee had told him of the giant with
fiery eyes who walked the wall at night, and the
little man, the bearer of the telescope, who followed
after, but he had quite frankly disbelieved
their story. It was, he had said, but the work of
their overwrought imagination. Now, as some
slight confirmation of its plausibility came to
him, he experienced an overpowering desire to go
once more to the crest of the Citadel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This time,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;I will avoid pitfalls.&rdquo;
For all that he found himself unable to
suppress a shudder as his foot touched the first
step of the stairway.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>During all this time Curlie was experiencing
unsurmountable difficulties in his work as an inventive
genius. The drums he had procured at
some hazard did not fulfill his purpose. One,
it was true, worked admirably. The other did
not work at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he grumbled to himself, &ldquo;one
could use whistles, but drums would be more effective
and dramatic.&rdquo; The thought that in this
land he might use the drums, which had played
so great a part in the history of the country, to
serve a new and strange end thrilled him to the
very center of his being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone knows that drums are of different
tones, the same as bells and whistles,&rdquo; he told
himself. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll find the ones I want though
they cost me thirty gourdes apiece.&rdquo; The
gourdes he spoke of were not the kind that grow
on vines but Haitian silver coins worth twenty
cents in American money.</p>
<p>Curious enough, just as he came to this conclusion
there sounded on the still night air a
faint, long drawn tum&mdash;tum&mdash;tum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are calling. The drums are calling,&rdquo;
he muttered. &ldquo;I must go. If it&rsquo;s the right one
I&rsquo;ll pay forty gourdes&mdash;and be glad enough to
make the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Curlie followed the sound of the drum. Not
always did he find the right trail. At times as
he skulked along beneath overhanging bushes
the sound grew fainter. Then he must turn, retrace
his steps to begin the search anew. In the
main, however, his keen senses served him well.</p>
<p>Moment by moment, yard by yard, mile by
mile the sound grew louder until at last the
throbbing, pulsating air seemed full of it.</p>
<p>Curlie marveled at the boldness of the drummers.
&ldquo;They know that all the men of Terre
Plaisance are gone,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;It is well
for them, else their drums would be split from
end to end and they&rsquo;d not get thirty gourdes for
them, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was just at this juncture that a curious thing
happened. As he moved stealthily forward, his
keen ear caught a sound not made by a drummer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A belated dancer,&rdquo; he thought. The fact
that someone was so near him in the dark disturbed
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>For all this he continued gliding silently forward
over the same trail. Eerie business this,
following another in the dark. Snap! went a
twig up there in the trail. Rustle, rustle sounded
the swinging bushes. Now he fancied he heard
a whispered conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might drop off at the side of the trail and
waylay me.&rdquo; His blood ran cold as he seemed
to feel the two-foot blade of a machete come down
upon his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beat &rsquo;em to it,&rdquo; he whispered to himself,
drawing forth his flashlight. &ldquo;One glimmer of
light full in the face, then I do the vanishing
act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few gliding foot-steps, then from his lips
there sounded a loud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant the white gleam of his flashlight
shot down the trail. It fell upon two startled
faces, one white, one coal black.</p>
<p>But Curlie did not do the disappearing act
into the brush. Instead he uttered a low exclamation
that expressed profound surprise. The
persons before him were Dot and her aged black
servant Mona.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what are you doing here?&rdquo; Dot
gasped, as he came forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a drum,&rdquo; he stated briefly. &ldquo;Buy that
drum. Pay forty gourdes if I must. That&rsquo;s the
drum I want. Just the right tone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what that drum may cost?&rdquo;
Dot&rsquo;s tone was impressive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not fifty, not a hundred, nor a thousand
gourdes, but many times that in money and men.
That is the war drum of the revolution. It says
that they have the black goat once more. Come
on. We are glad you are here. But we must
hasten. Even now we may be too late.&rdquo; The
French girl&rsquo;s dark eyes shone like fire as she
turned once more to take up the trail to follow
the sound of the drums.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><br />CHAPTER XVII
<br />THE WHITE SHADOW</h2>
<p>The trail this time was short. To Curlie&rsquo;s
heightened imagination it seemed but a
moment before he stood shoulder to shoulder
with the dark-eyed French girl, staring at a
scene such as no white person ever before witnessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are too late.&rdquo; It seemed to Curlie that
the girl said this, not with lips, but with heart
beats.</p>
<p>That the words were true he did not doubt, for
at that very moment the white blade of a long
knife flashed. It entered the heart of the black
goat. The creature quivered, then lay still,
quite dead, while the red blood flowed free.</p>
<p>The scene they witnessed that night will remain
with them long as life shall last. It was
the blood covenant of the blacks and was for war.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>It was over before their hearts had ceased their
wild beating. Then, in dead silence, with not a
drum beat, not a whisper, the natives filed away
into the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must follow,&rdquo; said Dot. &ldquo;For Haiti, and
her kindly, innocent people, we must follow.
The sacrifice has been made. But the torch of
war must not be lit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must not follow.&rdquo; The tone of Mona,
the black woman, was firm. &ldquo;If we follow we
will be surprised and killed. There is another
way. They go to Deception Bay where the ship
is and where are many rifles and much ammunition.
There is another trail. We will take it.
It goes to the top of a very steep cliff. There we
may look down upon them. After that we will
think of a way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is right,&rdquo; Curlie said to the girl. To the
native woman he said, &ldquo;Lead on. We will follow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>After that, for a half hour they followed the
black woman through such an intricate maze of
rocks, cliffs, vines and bushes as neither of them
had ever known before. Through it all the old
black woman never faltered. In the end, after
a final breathless climb of a hundred feet, they
found themselves looking down upon a scene of
matchless beauty. Riding high the moon painted
on a glassy sea a path of gold. Rock-ribbed, a
narrow bay lay before them. And close in, almost
beneath them, lay a large, full-rigged
schooner.</p>
<p>For a time they lay there side by side, the boy,
the girl, and the aged black woman. Straining
their eyes, listening with all their ears, they
strove to learn all that they might of this little
revolution that might grow into an affair of
grave consequence.</p>
<p>To their waiting ears there came at last a
series of low bumping sounds, as of someone
moving heavy objects across a floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are shifting the cargo. Getting ready
to unload, perhaps to-night,&rdquo; Mona&rsquo;s words came
short and quick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look!&rdquo; said Dot a moment later. &ldquo;A
boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rifles in cases,&rdquo; said Mona.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On such a moonlight night, would they
dare?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is a deserted spot. The goat has been
sacrificed. The terrible work must be begun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Curlie, &ldquo;we are too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the full meaning of all this came to Dot
she felt herself stifled with emotion. Rifles and
ammunition would be unloaded. Somewhere
there would be an attack. Peaceful, happy people
would be driven from their homes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;it will be our
village. Perhaps our home, our most beautiful
home where the pink roses bloom in the garden
and the nightingale sings in the cool of the evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thing seemed impossible. The air about
her was so still, the bay so placid. Haiti had
been so peaceful. And yet the history of Haiti
is a story of many revolutions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This little beginning may be part of a terrible
affair,&rdquo; she told herself. She recalled the
stories she had read of those remote days when
Napoleon tried with 20,000 picked soldiers to
subdue these people and had failed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are seven hundred Marines on the island,&rdquo;
she told herself. &ldquo;But what are they
against so many? This&mdash;this terrible schooner
will be everywhere, in all the little bays, lurking
about with rifles and ammunition to sell for gain
and at the cost of many human lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly a desperate measure suggested itself
to her. She recalled the incident of a few
nights before when, by shooting an arrow made
into a pitch-pine torch, Curlie had burned a cord
and loosed the black goat.</p>
<p>Curlie&rsquo;s bow and arrows were at this moment
close by his side. Near at hand was a dwarf
pine. It would furnish the pitch. In the center
of that boat lying down there in the bay stacked
round the mast was a pile of sleeping mats. Inch
thick affairs of palm fiber they were and dry as
tinder.</p>
<p>The schooner lay almost directly beneath them,
an easy shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One flaming arrow in that pile of sleeping
mats and the boat will be in flames.&rdquo; She said
these words aloud without really willing it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the ship carries much powder,&rdquo; said
Mona gripping Dot&rsquo;s arm until it hurt. &ldquo;It is
the way. He, the young man, must shoot the
arrow. He must shoot at once. See! I will
gather the rosin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She endeavored to spring to her feet but Dot
pulled her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;Wait. Wait one moment,&rdquo; Dot implored.
&ldquo;Those are bad men. Perhaps they do
not deserve to live, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do not deserve it.&rdquo; The native woman&rsquo;s
tone was bitter. &ldquo;That white man who owns that
ship sold the rifle that killed my father in a needless
revolution before the Americans came. He
does not deserve to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Curlie touching the girl&rsquo;s arm
lightly. &ldquo;There is no need for haste. They are
unloading rifles. Those long boxes could contain
nothing else. The ammunition remains on
board. Without it they can do nothing. I will
be back,&rdquo; he took a long breath, &ldquo;very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant he was lost in the shadows.
He did not for a moment doubt the wisdom and
justice of the aged black woman&rsquo;s plan. His
only thought was for the safety of the daring
girl who was willing to risk so much for a country
that was not her own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If the plan fails, if they see the descending
arrow and trace its course,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;if
they come storming up the cliff and block our
one way of escape, we are lost. I must find a
second way down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was gone but ten minutes. To the waiting
girl it seemed an hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is another way; very steep and dangerous,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;but a way of escape I believe.
Shall I shoot the arrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot the arrow.&rdquo; Her eyes gleamed in the
moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may discover us, may surround the
rock. I am not afraid for myself, but for you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot the arrow.&rdquo; He felt the warm pressure
of her hand on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot the arrow,&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may guess the source of the arrow.
Your home may be destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot the arrow.&rdquo; Her lips were close to his
ear, her tone low and tense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the rosin.&rdquo; The black woman&rsquo;s hand
trembled as she pressed a sticky ball into his own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>Seizing an arrow he rolled it over and over in
the sticky mass. Then, with a sudden intake of
breath he lighted a match. A moment later he
nocked his arrow to send it circling straight and
true, down, down, down to at last bury itself in
the pile of dry mats.</p>
<p>All unseen by the workers on the schooner, a
wisp of white smoke began mounting to the sky.
Then, with a suddenness that was startling, the
whole mass of mats burst out in red flame. Even
then they did not see. For a space of thirty
seconds they worked on. When at last the smell
of smoke reached their nostrils and they turned
to find themselves staring into the flames, they
acted according to their own natures.</p>
<p>A native seized a bucket of drinking water to
dash it into the flames. It might have been oil
for all the good it did. The mats, baked as they
had been in the dry Haitian sunlight, were
tinder. So too was the deck, the mast and the
rails of the schooner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>The schooner carried two dories. The one at
her side was more than half filled with heavy
boxes of rifles. Two natives, in an attempt to
lighten this dory, over-balanced it. It filled and
sank. All thought now was of escape. Men
poured from the cabin where they had been
sleeping. Brown men, red men, black men, men
of every hue, they stormed madly about the deck.</p>
<p>Two men, cooler than the rest, began launching
the remaining dory.</p>
<p>One man, wilder than the rest and possessing
no patience at all, leaped into the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The White Shadow!&rdquo; Mona screamed.
&ldquo;That man will perish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if hearing her call, the man turned his face
upward as he swam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the villain, the bad white man.&rdquo; Mona
put her hands to her eyes. &ldquo;It is he, yet I cannot
see him perish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without knowing why she did it, Dot followed
her example. For a full moment she remained
with covered eyes. Then, suddenly
realizing the peril of their position, she uncovered
her eyes and scrambled to her feet to exclaim:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curlie! Mona! The ship will explode. We
are in great danger! Back! Back! We must
get far back into the forest!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>Even with this warning Mona paused for a
last look. The ship was all in flames. The dory,
with its human freight, was moving rapidly
away. But the swimming white man, where was
he? Gone. Only where he had last been seen,
far below the surface, was a movement as of a
white sheet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The White Shadow of the sea,&rdquo; said Mona
as she turned to go racing away after her friends.</p>
<p>They had beaten their way back into the brush
for a distance of a hundred rods when of a sudden,
the very earth beneath them seemed torn in
pieces. So great was the explosion that they were
thrown to the earth and fine particles of debris
were sprinkled over them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Mona, &ldquo;is the end of the revolution.
And perhaps of all revolutions. That
heartless seller of arms will visit us no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later they were lying once more
upon the rock, looking down. All the overhanging
bushes and palms had been blown away.
The bay, a silent, beautiful blue, lay beneath
them. Only drifting fragments remained to tell
the story. A dory swamped near the farther
shore told that the crew had escaped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what is that white thing over there?&rdquo;
Dot asked, pointing away to the left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Curlie after one good look, &ldquo;is
the White Shadow of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shark!&rdquo; Dot said in great surprise. &ldquo;He
must have been killed by the explosion. But
see! Was there ever one as large as he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shark was indeed a monster; fully sixteen
feet long, with all his cruel teeth grinning he lay
there a terrible thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see, Mona,&rdquo; Dot said quietly, &ldquo;it is as
I have told you. Your White Shadow was but
one of God&rsquo;s living creatures, created beyond
doubt to do His will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; said Curlie suddenly
springing to his feet. A twig had snapped in
the brush behind them. In an instant Curlie&rsquo;s
flashlight revealed an ugly, distorted black face.
Quite as suddenly the face vanished into the
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Mona, &ldquo;was Pluto, the bad black
man, the bad white man&rsquo;s friend.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This affair,&rdquo; said Curlie, as they made their
way down the rugged cliff in the dark, &ldquo;is not
at an end. We have been seen. Who can tell
what will follow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very bad,&rdquo; said Mona.</p>
<p>That night, at a late hour, Curlie sat once more
by the window that looked out upon the garden
at the chateau. He was alone. Dot, he hoped,
was fast asleep. Johnny was far away. For all
that he was dreaming once more of a life of peace
in a garden of roses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace,&rdquo; he said at last, flinging his arms
wide. &ldquo;What chance is there for peace with such
a girl about? &lsquo;Shoot the arrow&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;Shoot
the arrow!&rsquo; and once more &lsquo;Shoot the arrow!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the same in the end he found himself admiring
the brown-eyed girl for her rare courage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><br />CHAPTER XVIII
<br />THE MAGIC TELESCOPE</h2>
<p>There was in Curlie Carson something of
the primitive man. Like the American
Indian or the Eskimo, if he hunted or prowled
half the night, he slept half the next day. The
tropical sun was high when he awoke. The particular
sound that disturbed his slumbers was
the barking of a dog&mdash;Dorn&rsquo;s dog. The dog
barked for joy. His young master had returned.
With Dorn was Pompee.</p>
<p>They had returned, Curlie heard them tell
Dot, because there was no use keeping camp at
the Citadel. Nothing ever happened there.
Nothing of importance was discovered and the
two young adventurers who had induced them to
take up camp there were forever getting themselves
lost. Just at the present moment they were
both lost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Curlie Carson is here,&rdquo; said Dot. &ldquo;He came
upon us in the dark last night. And how glad I
am that he did! We&mdash;we destroyed the supply
ship of the revolutionists. The revolution is over.
The bad white man is dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Dorn,&rdquo; Curlie heard her catch a long
hard breath, &ldquo;Pluto, the bad black man, is still
alive. He saw us last night after it was all over
and he understood. I know he did. And now
what will happen? Who can tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curlie had heard enough. His good friend
Johnny was lost once more. In the light of the
previous night&rsquo;s events that seemed serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may have known of our camp,&rdquo; he told
himself. &ldquo;Going there to waylay me they may
have come upon Johnny and taken him instead.
That settles it.&rdquo; There was an air of finality in
his tone. &ldquo;The whistles must do. The drums
would have been more dramatic, but there is no
time to lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a hasty toilet and a more hasty meal, he
bade good-bye to Dot and Doris, Dorn and Pompee,
then went hurrying away over the trail to
the Citadel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>Arriving at the grim old fortress just at nightfall,
he went at once to his laboratory. From
this place, after a half hour of banging and
bumping, he emerged laden with packages. Having
caught up with his burros he began loading
them. After six trips to the laboratory he at last
left it with the door ajar which told plainer than
words that whatever of value had been there was
now safely packed in hampers on the burros&rsquo;
backs.</p>
<p>Being a good trail hunter he was not long in
picking up a fresh scent that, to his great surprise,
he found led in the same direction as that
taken by the natives who had before spirited
Johnny away.</p>
<p>Had he known the full truth, he must have
been much more surprised for it was not alone
the same trail that Johnny had been taken over
but the same group of natives had taken him,
and, at the very moment when Curlie found the
trail, the same natives were breaking camp on
the identical spot at which Johnny, with the aid
of a ferocious wild boar, had made good his
escape only a few days previous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>It is said that lightning never strikes twice in
the same place. Something very like lightning
had struck Johnny twice. A second time as he
walked on the Citadel wall a group of bronze
natives had silently formed about him and had
spirited him away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time,&rdquo; he had told himself, as he recalled
the strange words of the short, broad man,
&ldquo;I will see the thing through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And well he might say this for now he was
caught quite helpless and unarmed. And no
wild boar had as yet come to his aid.</p>
<p>As before, the group of bronze natives taking
Johnny with them from the Citadel had traveled
all night without the aid of a light. As morning
dawned, they had sought out a secluded spot and
had breakfasted, without building a fire, on
fruits, nuts and cold cooked meats. With one
member of the band detailed to watch, they had
sprawled out among the ferns and had fallen
asleep. Not one of them slept better than Johnny,
for having once committed himself to a course
of action, he never allowed the strangeness of the
course nor the wildness of the land about him to
rob him of his rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>As night fell they resumed their journey. The
general direction of their course was not
changed. Once more they plodded steadily onward
over the narrow trail that now rose at an
abrupt angle, now ran on the level and now
dipped a trifle downward, as a mountain trail
will, but in the main bore steadily upward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the strangest thing I ever heard of,&rdquo;
Johnny told himself. &ldquo;I am not treated as a
prisoner. Yet they take me with them, nor do
they as much as say, &lsquo;By your leave.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the old resolve surged through his
being; he would see the thing through, come
what might.</p>
<p>What he saw and heard after three hours of
steady plodding caused him to start and wonder.
Having rounded a dark clump of southern pines,
they came quite suddenly upon a low burning
camp fire. And seated crosslegged before the
fire, smiling like some elfin king, was the short,
broad man who had already played so considerable
a part in the boy&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you came?&rdquo; he exclaimed in quite a genial
tone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Johnny rather slowly, &ldquo;I&mdash;I
came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hoped you would. Knew you too were trying
to help the natives of Haiti. Thought I
might help you. Sit down by the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Johnny&rsquo;s eyes became accustomed to the
dim firelight, he noted that a large brass tube lay
across the mysterious man&rsquo;s knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the stranger as he saw Johnny&rsquo;s
eyes resting upon it, &ldquo;is the Magic Telescope of
the old Emperor Christophe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That! It&mdash;it can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not the least doubt about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it must be more than a hundred years
old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a little more. Look closely and you
will see the date&rsquo;s still there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held up a blazing ember. Johnny, looking
close, read there: &ldquo;Paris, France, 1797.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo; His tone was filled with awe.</p>
<p>At once, as he settled back in his place his
mind was filled with strange stories that had
been told of Christophe and this telescope and
its magic properties.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, of course,&rdquo; he said to the little man, &ldquo;the
magic part was all myth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said the other without answering
his question, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a strangely powerful instrument.
I&rsquo;ll demonstrate. Come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the way to a cleared spot above a rocky
ledge that was like an observation post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will follow the direction the telescope
points,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;you will be able to
locate the Citadel. The rising moon brings it
out in rather strong relief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Johnny was astonished at its apparent
nearness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You followed an irregular trail in coming
here,&rdquo; the other offered. &ldquo;For all that it&rsquo;s some
distance away. Now try this.&rdquo; He placed the
priceless relic of other days in Johnny&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>For a time as he lifted the telescope to his eyes,
his trembling hands defeated his purpose, but
at last the parapets of the ancient fortress stood
out in startling clearness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s marvelous!&rdquo; he said in a low
whisper as if afraid the ghosts of other days
might overhear. &ldquo;It is as if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As if one were right there,&rdquo; put in the short
broad man. &ldquo;Exactly so. And it might interest
you to know,&rdquo; he said as he dropped to a seat on
a fallen tree trunk well back from the edge of
the precipice, &ldquo;that the Citadel has been watched
from this point, through this very glass, every
day for more than a hundred years&mdash;since the
death of Christophe, in fact. You have heard
the story of the telescope?&rdquo; He asked quite
suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;But after the Emperor&rsquo;s
death, how did it come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brown boy, carrier of the telescope during
Christophe&rsquo;s reign, was a native of this very
mountain,&rdquo; said the little man. &ldquo;He and his
tribe were loyal to the Emperor. After his death
they remained loyal still. They took an oath to
watch the Citadel and to defend it from vandals.
That is why the watch has been kept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that explains&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It explains many things. There is a rumor
that the bearer of the telescope knew the secret
of the Emperor&rsquo;s treasure and that is why they
guard the Citadel so very carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If they know that,&rdquo; said Johnny, suddenly
springing to his feet, &ldquo;then they know the hiding
place of the &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rumor has never been confirmed,&rdquo; said
the little man, rising and turning away from the
ledge. &ldquo;It is probably one of those myths that
spring up from time to time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as to the &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo;,&rdquo; he added as an
apparent after-thought, &ldquo;whether the rumor were
true or not will not make the least difference.
The &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo; is not in the Citadel and
never was. Come, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; He struck back
over the trail at a stride quite astonishing for
one so short of stature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows where the &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo; has
been.&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s heart throbbed. &ldquo;Perhaps he
knows where it is to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time they tramped along in silence.
They were, Johnny discovered, not going to the
camp spot they had left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;These people,&rdquo; said the short, broad man
after a time, &ldquo;are not black men. They are
Indians, almost pure stock, the kind of men
Columbus found when first he landed here. They
do not build houses as the blacks do. They live
in groves and caves. We will soon come to one
of their caves. Whatever you see or hear, have
no fear. They have known me for more than
twenty years. So long as I am with you, you are
safe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><br />CHAPTER XIX
<br />AN APE-LIKE BAND</h2>
<p>Johnny spent the remainder of that night
in the most curious place he had yet seen in
Haiti&mdash;at the mouth of a cave. How far back
the cave extended into the mountain he had no
notion. He did know that the night air at this
high altitude was crisp and cool, that his thick
bed of mats was comfortable and the home-woven
blankets ample for warmth. This, however, did
not at once induce sleep. The day had been too
full of adventure and fresh revelation for that.</p>
<p>When he realized that their every act at the
Citadel had been watched through the &ldquo;magic
telescope&rdquo; it gave him a peculiar feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;we have done
nothing but look about. We have not removed
a stone from its place in the ancient walls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well enough that we didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he mused.
&ldquo;That little man told me that the &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo;
has never been at the Citadel. Wonder how he
knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The natural answer to this question came to
him as something of a shock. &ldquo;If a man knows
for sure that a thing is not in a certain place and
never has been there, he needs must know where
it has been and where it is now,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;And if only he would tell me,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;But
that, of course, is not to be expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were other problems to be studied out.
He had been brought to this spot for a purpose.
What could that purpose be? Were these bronze
men afraid that he and Curlie would chance upon
some of the ancient treasure? Did they propose
to break up their search by holding him
prisoner? If so, where did this strange white
man come in? To this question he could form
no answer, so still puzzling over it he fell asleep.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>As you know, when Curlie Carson, with his
heavily laden donkeys, took the trail in search
of Johnny Thompson, he left his laboratory
stripped of all contents. It was well that he did,
for only two hours after he left, a band of blacks,
some fifty in number, came scrambling up the
trail that leads to the Citadel. They were led by
a black man with a face of such fierce ugliness
as one seldom sees on land or sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>Arrived at the Citadel, they scattered as if in
search of someone. When two of them came upon
Curlie&rsquo;s abandoned laboratory they let out a
cry and at once the entire band swarmed around
them.</p>
<p>Finding the place deserted, they wrecked it,
tearing up tables and shelves, even wrenching the
door from its hinges.</p>
<p>When one member, keener eyed than the
others, discovered Curlie&rsquo;s trail leading away into
the hills, the whole band, like a pack of hounds
in full cry, went yelling and roaring away after
the boy and his donkeys.</p>
<p>What a strange and terrible horde they were.
Leaning far forward as they ran they seemed
more like a pack of gigantic baboons than men.
But woe unto any human being who might fall
into their clutches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>As for Curlie Carson, he plodded doggedly on
before his burros, picking out the trail leading
the way, steadily and surely, toward Johnny&rsquo;s
cave.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>On the day that Curlie left the chateau to go
in search of Johnny, Doris and Dot started on
an expedition all their own. With imagination
fired by dreams of the ancient black queen&rsquo;s
treasure, still dreaming of seeing again that
monkey with the diamond ring on his wrist, they
proposed to visit the ruins of the black emperor&rsquo;s
palace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take Mona,&rdquo; Dot said. &ldquo;Now that the
revolution has been brought to an end there is no
danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris thought of the ugly black foe that Dot
and Curlie had seen at the top of the cliff after
the explosion, and experienced a moment of uneasiness.
But so eager was she to begin the search
that she was able at once to cast fears aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a race,&rdquo; she said with a little wild
skipping, &ldquo;a race between the boys and ourselves
to see who first discovers treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; laughed Dot, &ldquo;a race that is likely to
end with a draw. Everybody loses.&rdquo; Despite
this dire prophecy, they departed in high spirits
and ere twilight came found themselves camping
within the shadows of the impressive stone steps
that had once led to a palace of such magnificence
and grandeur as no other black ruler has known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think,&rdquo; Doris told herself as two hours
later she lay beneath the blankets awaiting sleep,
&ldquo;that up those steps in days long gone by one
passed gorgeously attired dukes and earls with
their women all aglitter with jewels. And now
here we are, just two girls and one old black
woman, all alone with all the ruined magnificence.
Here we are and to-morrow&mdash;Oh, you
glorious to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To-morrow they would explore the mysterious
pile of brick and stone that had once been a
king&rsquo;s palace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treasure,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;That magic
word treasure. There was treasure aplenty here
in those all but forgotten days. Who knows but
it lies hidden away here still? Who knows&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her thoughts broke short off. There had come
a faint scratching sound from the palm fronds
above her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Blackbird. Some old blackbird,&rdquo; she told
herself. She was not quite satisfied with this.
A tropical blackbird, she remembered, was always
talking to himself and fluttering in and
out among the branches. The thing troubled her.
It was night and the jungle was new to her. She
thought of snakes. Snakes, she remembered,
glided about in trees. She had seen a picture of
a huge one hanging over a limb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But everyone says there are no dangerous
creatures in the Haitian jungle, not even snakes,&rdquo;
she reassured herself. She settled back in her
place. The rustling for the time had ceased.
&ldquo;Just some bird,&rdquo; she told herself once more.</p>
<p>Her right hand went to her left wrist. There
something gave forth a jingling sound. Doris
was not given to wearing jewelry. Notwithstanding
this, before starting on this trip she had surprised
her companions by putting on her three
bracelets and even borrowing two others from
Dot. Dot hadn&rsquo;t asked why she wanted to wear
them, but she had wondered about it. They were
on her wrist still.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seems sort of foolish,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
glad I brought them though, for you really never
can tell. They say that monkeys travel far. And
if we found him it really might work. And
if&mdash;Why! What was that?&rdquo; Something had
hit her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was thrown or dropped,&rdquo; she told herself,
now quite genuinely alarmed. &ldquo;Who could have
done that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she thought as her heart gave a
leap, &ldquo;there are natives about these ruins.&rdquo; She
thought of the black face the others had seen at
the top of the cliff by Deception Bay. With an
unsteady hand she drew a flashlight from her
pocket. Having snapped it on, she set its circle
of light searching for the thing that had struck
her hand. A half minute of this, then she gave
forth a low chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only some creature shucking a cocoanut up
there,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>The next instant her face was quite serious.
&ldquo;If it were the monkey; if it only could be the
jeweled monkey.&rdquo; Her heart raced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>Directing the ray of light upward she was just
in time to catch sight of a pair of small eyes peering
down at her. The next instant they were gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>was</i> a monkey!&rdquo; she told herself with a
quick intake of breath. &ldquo;It was! It was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; she told herself more soberly,
&ldquo;there may be many tame monkeys in the hills
who have turned wild. I have heard of three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a long time she kept the light playing upon
the fronds of the palm, but all to no purpose.
She saw nothing more of the creature who had
showered her with cocoanut shucks. At last, as
her rebellious eyelids grew heavy, she crept up
to a place beside her pal and fell asleep. But
even in her sleep she dreamed of palatial halls,
soft carpets, gleaming chandeliers and of diamonds
worn by black ladies dressed for state.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><br />CHAPTER XX
<br />THE CHEST OF SECRETS</h2>
<p>All that night, Curlie Carson plodded doggedly
on before his three burros. Had he
known of his pal&rsquo;s safety, he must surely have
camped beside the trail and slept. As it was he
did not pause for rest.</p>
<p>As the black horde on Curlie&rsquo;s trail traveled
light, with no donkeys to be urged forward, they
made hourly gains on the lone plodder. In the
beginning Curlie had a start of ten miles. Two
hours had not passed before this lead was cut to
eight miles. Midnight found them but four
miles behind. As dawn broke, had the trail been
straight and broad instead of crooked and narrow,
they must surely have caught sight of Curlie&rsquo;s
lagging donkeys. And then&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>But fate was with the lone traveler. They
did not see; they could not know how near they
were to the one on whom they hoped to wreak
vengeance. And as the sun came out hot on the
jungle trail, they began, animal-like, to drop
beside the trail to rest.</p>
<p>At last with half his force missing, the revengeful
leader angrily called a halt and made
rude camp for the day. In this he missed his
opportunity, for Curlie, after a brief pause to
allow his donkeys to browse on the tree leaves
and wiry grass, pressed tirelessly on through the
long hot day. Only as evening fell did he tether
his beasts and lie him down to close his weary
eyes in sleep.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Meanwhile Doris and Dot were not without
their exciting hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! There! There he is!&rdquo; It was Doris
who spoke. She danced up and down in wild
excitement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where? Where?&rdquo; Dot asked in great bewilderment.
Night had passed. Morning had
dawned with vivid clearness over the ruins of the
ancient castle. Breakfast was over and the girls
for three hours past had been exploring the ruins.
On tiptoes they had ascended the massive moss-grown
stairs that in the distant past had led to
stately halls. They had come upon great heaps
of stone and brick mantled by clinging bush and
creeping vine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is as if nature would hide it all.&rdquo; Doris
had said, a touch of sadness in her tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dot. &ldquo;And why not? The man
who built the castle turned tyrant. He sold his
splendid birthright for power and gold. Had
he proven a kind and just ruler his castle might
have been standing to this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were wandering still among the ruins
when the great moment had arrived. Doris did
not answer her companion&rsquo;s excited questions.
She only pointed at the top of a jagged pile of
rock and Dot saw for herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The monkey!&rdquo; exclaimed Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The jeweled monkey,&rdquo; Doris answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And see!&rdquo; she said, gripping at her heart to
still its wild beating. &ldquo;There are now three rings
on his arm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. From the small creature&rsquo;s arm
there gleamed three jewels, two white stones and
a red one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Two diamonds and a ruby,&rdquo; whispered Dot.
&ldquo;If only we can get them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we can find the hiding place from
which they come,&rdquo; said Doris.</p>
<p>Dot was thinking hard. Of all the exciting
moments in her young life, this was the wildest,
yet she knew that few things were accomplished
in moments of wild excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be calm,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes for a moment that her wild
spirits might be stilled.</p>
<p>Doris too was thinking and as she thought she
put her hand to her bracelets. She wondered,
as she did so, whether her finely laid plan would
work.</p>
<p>Moving one step nearer to the motionless monkey
she squatted down in the identical posture he
had assumed, then having removed one bracelet
from her wrist she placed it on the rock before
her. This done she removed another and yet
another until the five bracelets lay on the rocks
before her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>She then replaced all the bracelets upon her
wrist; waited a moment only to repeat the operation.
When she had removed the bracelets six
times, she left them lying on the rock to turn her
back and walk away motioning her companion
to follow her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! What in the world?&rdquo; Dot whispered
as they hid behind a clump of bushes.</p>
<p>Doris held up a hand for silence. It was indeed
a bold game she was playing. She prized
her bracelets because they came from very dear
friends. And if she lost Dot&rsquo;s? She dared not
think of it.</p>
<p>That the monkey would do one of two things
she felt quite certain. &ldquo;If he should take a fancy
to the bracelets,&rdquo; she drew in a quick breath at
the thought.</p>
<p>But no! As they peered through the bushes
they saw that the monkey was acting true to
form. He was imitating the girl&rsquo;s action. Having
removed the three rings from his arm he
placed them on a flat rock. This done he placed
them again on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will he go away and leave them?&rdquo; Doris
asked herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>Three tense moments followed, moments in
which the monkey followed out the girl&rsquo;s pantomime
to the last detail.</p>
<p>Then to Doris&rsquo; intense delight, he went scampering
away.</p>
<p>Twenty seconds later Doris&rsquo; hand was closing
over the three precious stones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a shame to do it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But these
stones will do us much more good than they
could possibly do any monkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see them,&rdquo; said Dot eagerly stretching
out a hand.</p>
<p>She took one of the white stone rings from
her open palm. Then having taken a small mirror
from her pocket, she drew the corner of the stone
across it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s real. It cuts
glass. It&rsquo;s a diamond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be still!&rdquo; said Doris gripping her arm.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll frighten the monkey away. I&rsquo;m afraid
that we have killed the goose that lays the golden
egg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killed what?&rdquo; Dot stared at her in surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; said Doris, &ldquo;what we might
have done? If our monkey friend has found
two rings in the last few days, who can say how
many more treasures there are hidden where
these rings were found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who indeed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we could have followed him to the
source of his treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can! We can!&rdquo; exclaimed Dot, springing
up. &ldquo;There he goes now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant they were following on the
trail of the fleet-footed monkey. In no time at
all Dot, surer of foot and more accustomed to
rough travel in the tropics, was far in the lead
of her cousin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;ll lose him!&rdquo; she panted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look,&rdquo; said Doris, trying her best to keep
up. &ldquo;He is leaving the ruins and taking to the
forest.&rdquo; Her tone showed her disappointment.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not going to his treasure-house. He&rsquo;s trying
to escape us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never can tell,&rdquo; said Dot. &ldquo;Anyway we
must follow him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So once more in the stifling heat of a Haitian
day they took up the wild race that led on to
victory or defeat, to treasure or disappointment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>A half hour of exciting struggle through
brush, bush and tangled vines and then, just as
hope was waning, they came to an open space to
discover there a heap of broken masonry. And
atop the pile, Oh, joy of joys! was the jeweled
monkey.</p>
<p>One moment he blinked at them, the next he
disappeared into the ruins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dot!&rdquo; said Doris. &ldquo;What if this should
prove to be the place of the queen&rsquo;s treasure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Dot, after a moment of rest and
thought, &ldquo;is what we are about to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together, hand in hand, feeling like Twin
Alices in Wonderland, they marched to the
ruins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Dot, &ldquo;is the ruins of the black
emperor&rsquo;s hunting lodge. I have heard of it, but
no one I know has ever seen it. Look,&rdquo; she said
as she mounted the pile. &ldquo;The monkey went
down through that small hole to the cavity beneath
that large rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must roll the stone away,&rdquo; said Doris excitedly.
&ldquo;There must be a chest down there, a
huge copper chest filled with jewels and gold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>Instantly all save the treasure was forgotten.
The heat, approaching night, the trouble and
labor that had been theirs, all was forgotten in
their one desire to roll away the stone.</p>
<p>For a time all went well. A dozen smaller
stones were sent tumbling down the sloping pile.
The monkey, who had left his retreat, chattered
encouragement from a nearby treetop. When at
last they came to the key stone they found, to
their consternation, that their combined strength
could not move it. Three times they attempted
it. Then panting and perspiring, with sore
hands and heavy hearts, they sat down to think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we had brought old Pompee with us,&rdquo;
said Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so hungry I could eat anything,&rdquo; said
Doris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; said Dot, who was a hard
loser. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have one more try at that big
stone. There&rsquo;s a stout lignumvitae pole over
there. It&rsquo;s dreadfully heavy, heaviest wood in
the world, but we can handle it. We&rsquo;ll get one
end under the stone, then use it as a pry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>Wearily the girls climbed down to tug away
at the pole. Up it went and into place. Then
presto! Down it came and up came the stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grand!&rdquo; said Dot. &ldquo;Now you sit on the end
of the pole and I&rsquo;ll have a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; she shouted a moment later. &ldquo;Here
is a hole, a regular grotto, and I see something
shining down there. We&rsquo;ve found the chest of
gold. You just sit tight where you are on the
pole and I&rsquo;ll go down. Don&rsquo;t move though or
you might drop the stone on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down she went. The place she entered was
not over three feet across. It had jagged edges
and led down to what had once been a solid floor,
some eight feet below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! I&rsquo;m down!&rdquo; Doris heard her say.
&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s a chest of secrets!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chest she spoke of was a rather small
affair; little more than a lady&rsquo;s jewel box.</p>
<p>The earthquake which had wrecked the walls
of the ancient lodge had crushed the chest as
well. One hinge was gone, the lock was broken,
and it lay half on its side with its contents spilled
over the rocks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>That the objects the box had contained were of
considerable value Dot knew. She set herself
to the task of gathering them together. Darting
her flashlight about she discovered here a diamond
brooch, there a ruby set shoe buckle and
here its mate, here a curious ring set with a more
curious stone and there a belt buckle set with a
spray of small diamonds.</p>
<p>She had righted the box, had replaced the contents
and was darting her light about for a last
look when, of a sudden, a terrible thing happened.</p>
<p>No one knew just how it came about. To sit
on a smooth pole for a considerable length of
time is a trying and difficult task. When one is
weary it is worse. Perhaps Doris moved a trifle
to ease a benumbed muscle. Perhaps she fell half
asleep and moved unconsciously. Whatever it
might be, the pole suddenly swung to the right,
there came a sickening grind and the great rock
fell into place, sealing Dot up beneath the rock
as effectively as if it had been a tomb.</p>
<p>Could anything be worse? Their treasure hunt
had ended in disaster. Doris sat down upon the
ruins to cover her aching eyes with her hands
and to try to think calmly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>Night was coming on. Already the shadows
were falling. There was an ominous muttering
from off in the east.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may rain. She may be drowned in that
horrible well of a place.&rdquo; For the first time she
found herself hating the jeweled monkey. To
make matters worse the graceful creature sat on
a low hanging limb and chuckled as in high glee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Doris called to Dot at last in
the most cheerful tone she could command. &ldquo;I
will go to our camp for Mona. The two of us
can roll the stone away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The camp,&rdquo; Dot answered, &ldquo;is miles away.
Besides, Mona is old. She has no strength. You
two could not roll the stone away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Doris, &ldquo;I must go for someone
else. You can&rsquo;t remain there forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;d better go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo; Something akin to
a sob followed Doris&rsquo; words &ldquo;Good bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good bye.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>She was gone. Night settled down swiftly as
nights will in the tropics. Dot was left to herself
and the ancient treasure that had in its day
witnessed so much of glory and honor, so much of
baseness and defeat. As she sat there in the little
dark hole it seemed to her that the long-lost jewels
spoke to her telling her how all that is bright,
rich and glorious must fade and pass away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever I get out of this alive,&rdquo; she told herself,
&ldquo;my share of jewels shall be used in a way
that will make a few people in this old world
happier and better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strangely enough, this resolve brought to her
a peace she had not known before. It was as if
some great spirit, kinder and more noble than
she could ever hope to be, had whispered a solemn
&ldquo;Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><br />CHAPTER XXI
<br />JOHNNY&rsquo;S MISSION</h2>
<p>In his cave near the top of the mountain,
Johnny slept soundly. But the first faint
streak of dawn found him wide awake and staring
up at the stone that formed the roof of the
cave. He had been engaged in this rather fruitless
occupation for a full ten minutes, when, with
a suddenness that might have been startling to
an observer, he sat bolt upright to stare with all
his eyes at some object far back in the cave.</p>
<p>Well he might stare, for there, but half revealed
by the dim light, apparently suspended
from the roof of the cave, was what appeared to
be a mammoth dull yellow and green snake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;And yet, if
not, what can it be? I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His thoughts were broken in upon by a cheerful
voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleep well?&rdquo; It was the short, broad man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out with me into the light. Bit dismal
in the cave.&rdquo; The little man seized him by the
arm to fairly shove him toward the door. As
Johnny turned about for one more look at that
fantastic thing clinging to the cave&rsquo;s roof, the
little man appeared to redouble his efforts. Yet
in that last look Johnny obtained a further impression
that was startling in the extreme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to have a talk with you before the
natives were about,&rdquo; said the little man, as they
seated themselves on mossy rocks beneath a low,
spreading tree. &ldquo;They would not understand us
for they speak only the lowest Creole. However,
they would disturb us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I sent for you,&rdquo; he began after a moment&rsquo;s
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sent&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you not guess? Did they not tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The natives speak only Creole,&rdquo; said Johnny.
&ldquo;I do not understand that language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then in a few words he told of his strange experience
with the bronze natives.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to have caused you unnecessary
trouble,&rdquo; said the little man. &ldquo;However, it was
necessary for you to come. In the end you will
not regret it I am sure. I am in a position, I
think, to do you a lasting favor. That, however,
must wait. It might help you to understand and
lead you the more readily to consent to any
proposition I may care to make, should I tell you
a little more of myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was born,&rdquo; he said, half closing his eyes as
if to recall the past, &ldquo;to a life of pain. Infantile
paralysis struck me when I was less than a year
old. Many doctors were called in consultation,
for my father was a banker of some means. All
told the same story. I would never walk, never
feed myself, probably never talk. But after
these, when I was five years old, came one greater
than them all. He freed me from my terrible
bondage. True, I have never been just as other
men are. But that, my boy,&rdquo; he laid a hand impressively
on Johnny&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;that does not matter.
The only thing that really matters in this world
is that a man have a mission and that he be
equipped to fulfil that mission. Many a man
who has been looked down upon, pitied, or
scorned, because of physical infirmity has made
a great and lasting contribution to the world&rsquo;s
true wealth and happiness. I studied medicine.
When I had finished my course I said, &lsquo;I will
find the neediest people in the world and serve
them.&rsquo; I found, I believe, the neediest people
right here in Haiti. And here I am serving
them, and shall be until I die. Money,&rdquo; he said
thoughtfully, &ldquo;I do not ask from them. I have
a small income from my father&rsquo;s estate. It is
ample. Loyalty, love, a certain amount of gratitude,
these are my reward. And right royally I
am paid. You too,&rdquo; he said once more touching
Johnny on the arm, &ldquo;have a desire to serve.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it will be possible for me to aid you,&rdquo;
the little doctor broke in eagerly. &ldquo;But first, before
you know more, I have a mission, a hard one
for you to perform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name it,&rdquo; said Johnny, springing to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p>
<p>Johnny sat down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;While you slept,&rdquo; the little doctor&rsquo;s tone became
deeply impressive, &ldquo;a man lay at the back
of the cave, fighting a battle, perhaps his last
battle with disease. He is very old; is not longer
able to resist, and I, as a doctor, am able to do
little for him. This man,&rdquo; he went on, as his
tone grew mellow, &ldquo;is a native, a member of the
tribe. Yet for more than twenty years, I have
counted him my dearest friend. His family
seem to have absorbed some of the greatness, generosity
and nobleness of the black emperor at his
best; for it was his father who always bore the
Magic Telescope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is the son of the bearer of the telescope.
Father and son, they have more than
spanned the century. But now his light burns
dim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor&rsquo;s next remark was surprising.
&ldquo;You, I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have something to gain
by his death. And yet,&rdquo; he added at once, &ldquo;I am
going to ask you to go on a mission which may
add some months, perhaps years to his life.
Knowing you, having studied you, I know that
you will do your best though failure might bring
you a million.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A human life,&rdquo; said Johnny quietly. &ldquo;What
is a million dollars to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. You are quite right,&rdquo; said the
doctor.</p>
<p>He rose to stand before the boy and point away
toward a distant valley. &ldquo;At the point of that
valley is a humble village. There, for many
years, I have had my home. In my home is a
small laboratory. In it is the greater part of my
medicine. One of those medicines may save this
man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it were merely a matter of bringing it, I
should send a native. Unfortunately it must first
be distilled. It is, at the present moment, in a
small distillery in one corner of the room. You
have only to light the alcohol lamp and wait until
the distilling process has been accomplished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the place?&rdquo; said Johnny, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will send a guide with you. He knows
every foot of the way. And remember,&rdquo; he
added, &ldquo;I am not sending you because I am unwilling
myself to endure the hardship of the
journey. For reasons I cannot at this time explain,
I wish to remain beside the man who is
fighting for his life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready to go,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your breakfast is here,&rdquo; said the doctor.
&ldquo;When it is finished your guide will be ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Johnny followed a lean,
muscular bronze man down the trail that led
away and away over hillside and mountain, down
valley, through forest and jungle to the village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That native looks like one who cannot grow
weary,&rdquo; the boy told himself. He was to learn
in time that this was true and was to feel thankful
for his own physical training.</p>
<p>In the meantime, he had abundant food for
thought. His mind was full of many wonders.
He had left camp at the Citadel without taking
leave. What of Dorn and Pompee? What of
Curlie? He wondered most about the curious
things the little doctor had said. How was the
doctor to be of service to him and to the cause he
had espoused? How, of all things, could he profit
by the death of an old man, the son of the
bearer of the Magic Telescope?</p>
<p>After a time he thought again of the golden
green serpent hanging from the roof of the cave&mdash;or
was it a serpent?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>Mid-afternoon found him at the distant native
village. Having dined while the distilling went
forward, he bottled the fluid, and turning his
face upward, was prepared to follow his tireless
guide back to the cave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><br />CHAPTER XXII
<br />THE QUEEN&rsquo;S RUBY</h2>
<p>Darkness had fallen as Curlie Carson,
still following the trail of his good pal
Johnny, and still urging his donkeys forward,
approached the mouth of the cave occupied by the
bronze natives and the little doctor. Johnny, as
you will know, had been gone from that place
several hours. He was now well on his way back.</p>
<p>The black horde, had Curlie but known it, was
but two hours behind him on the trail. He did
not know. All he knew was that his good pal
was missing and that he had passed this way.</p>
<p>By great good fortune, the first person he met
was the short broad man, the white doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny?&rdquo; the little doctor smiled in answer
to Curlie&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;Sure we had him. We let
him go. But he&rsquo;ll be back; may be here at any
time. Sit down and rest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Beppo,&rdquo; he spoke to a bronze native,
&ldquo;bring us some of that roasted guinea hen and
boiled plantain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Curlie had eaten and had fed his donkeys
from a bundle of wild grass, the little
doctor told him as much as he deemed best of
Johnny&rsquo;s latest adventure. He showed him the
Magic Telescope and bade him make himself at
home.</p>
<p>Hardly had he finished speaking when a
bronze native, panting and quite done in by running,
dropped at his feet. When this man found
his breath he told a startling tale of a black, ape-like
horde of men, armed with clubs, machetes
and rifles who were marching upon the cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; said the doctor, turning to Curlie
for an answer. &ldquo;We are a peaceful people.
Have you brought this mob to attack us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curlie&rsquo;s eyes went wide with wonder. The
whole affair was news to him. A few well directed
questions and he knew the worst. The
leader of this band was none other than Pluto,
the bad black man whose shipload of arms he had
sunk. The others were his followers. That they
were bent on vengeance he did not doubt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time for explaining now,&rdquo; he said
springing to his feet and seizing a heavy hamper.
&ldquo;Those men are not my friends but my enemies.
I think you may leave them to me. But if your
men will carry all these heavy hampers into the
cave, it will help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There is a destiny&rsquo;,&rdquo; he quoted to himself,
&ldquo;&lsquo;that shapes our ends&rsquo;. A moment ago I was
thinking what a lot of wasted toil it had been,
urging those stubborn donkeys up this trail. But
now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later he found himself busy erecting
in the mouth of the cave a figure that was as
fear-inspiring to the timid bronze men as he
hoped it might be to the black horde.</p>
<p>This figure it was that had absorbed so much
of his thought and occupied his hours in his
laboratory at the Citadel.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>At ten that night Johnny was still toiling up
the trail. As he paused to drink deep of the cool
night air, he caught the gleam of lightning and
felt some seconds later the shudder of the mountain
as the thunder came rolling in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Going to storm,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Wonder
if we&rsquo;ll make it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dot too heard the thunder. She too wondered.
Her wonder was of a different sort. She was
still imprisoned. Doris had gone for aid. She
had not returned&mdash;might not return until morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if it storms.&rdquo; She shuddered anew at
the thought. A severe tropical storm is not soon
forgotten. Dot had passed through one. It had
uprooted century old trees, brought great ships
ashore to break them on the rocks and had
changed the very aspect of the country.</p>
<p>That she might not lose her grip on her nerves,
she began prowling around her prison. Nor did
her search go unrewarded. Of a sudden, as she
shot her light in a dark hole behind a rock, she
gave forth a low cry of surprise and fear. It
seemed to her that a single fiery red eye was
gleaming up at her.</p>
<p>A second, a calmer look and she knew that she
was gazing upon the largest, most beautiful
stone she had yet discovered, a huge ruby set in
a circle of gold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Queen&rsquo;s Ruby,&rdquo; she told herself, holding
it up to the light. There is a legend that the
black queen always wore at her throat a gleaming
solitary ruby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only some one would come,&rdquo; she said to
herself. &ldquo;If they only would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer was a second roll of thunder.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>In the meantime Johnny was making the best
of his way up the mountain. Now he was two
miles away, now only one. And now, as he
paused once more at the top of a steep climb he
caught an odd confusion of noises. His guide
too heard and at once became violently excited.
He began dancing about and howling in a strange
manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; the boy asked, after he
had seized him and forced him into silence.</p>
<p>To this question the native made no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use asking more,&rdquo; the boy told himself.
&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t understand a word of English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately, upon being released, the fellow
renewed his howling and dancing. In this manner
he danced himself quite out of sight. That
was the last seen of him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>But Johnny no longer needed a guide. The
way was plain, straight ahead and up&mdash;up&mdash;up.
He needed someone to explain the loud tum&mdash;tum&mdash;tum
of drums, the wild screeching and
screaming that came to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The son of the bearer of the Magic Telescope
is dead,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;And this is the
funeral chant. Or perhaps a witch doctor has
arrived, some <i>Papa Lou</i> who is trying out his
incantations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coming at last upon a clump of tropical pines
that shut the traveler off from a view of the cave&rsquo;s
mouth, he drew a long breath, stepped boldly forward,
then stopped still to stare.</p>
<p>Before the cave, grotesquely lighted up by
wavering torches, was the wildest, most terrible
assembly of faces he had ever looked upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s like a moving picture scene taken
from the Hunchback of Notre Dame,&rdquo; he told
himself. &ldquo;How terrible they are! And how
they howl. What can it all mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>As he moved a few paces forward and to his
right for a better view his astonishment knew no
bounds. For there in the mouth of the cave, facing
the angry mob of blacks, stood a gigantic
solitary figure. Not a human figure was he, but
like one. He had arms that now waved madly
from side to side and now shot outward and upward
as if to rain blows upon an approaching
enemy. He had legs that now were motionless
and now set him bobbing wildly up and down
like an angry child. He had eyes that gleamed
now green, now red, now blue, and jaws that
from time to time snapped and cracked like the
clamps of a steel trap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of such things,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;madness is
made.&rdquo; He stepped back into the shadows.</p>
<p>Unable to understand the least bit of this wild
scene, he found one thought uppermost in his
mind; he bore in a sack at his side the precious
medicine that might mean life to a dying man.
Somehow he must enter the cave. To pass
through that angry mob was unthinkable&mdash;and
impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a secret entrance over here to the
right,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;I will go that way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>Turning, he wearily retraced his steps to approach
the cave from a different angle. And
still the flashes of light, green, red and blue, continued;
so too did the screams and drum beats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to come of it all?&rdquo; he asked himself,
and found no answer.</p>
<p>Once more came the roar and shudder of
thunder, this time louder and more terrifying.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Dot, still trapped among the rocky ruins, heard
that thunder. She heard something more. That
something set her heart beating wildly. It was
the voice of her cousin, calling: &ldquo;Dot! Dot!
Are you still there? Just think! I have found
the King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King. There is no King.&rdquo; Dot thought
her cousin out of her senses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Marine King of Manowa. He was coming
to see about the revolution. And I found
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have you out of there in two shakes,&rdquo;
said the King. &ldquo;Just sit tight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now where&rsquo;s that pole? Oh yes, here it is.
Guess you&rsquo;re lucky. Going to be a peach of a
storm. Less than an hour. Now young lady, out
on the end and down we go. Up goes the stone.
No. She slipped. Let&rsquo;s heave her up again.
Now! Down we go. There you are. Crawl
out. Double quick time. Trench duty with no
frills. Hurray! Here she is laden with treasure
and safe as a buck private in the guard house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was with the greatest difficulty that Dot restrained
herself from hugging the King as she
tumbled off the pile of rocks. She did grip his
arm hard and tell him how very, very thankful
she was that there was at least one king left in
the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the King in very blunt language,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to beat it and that all-fired
fast!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><br />CHAPTER XXIII
<br />THE BATTLING GIANT</h2>
<p>Having completed his detour, Johnny at
last entered the cave by the secret door.
He found the confusion within the cave almost
as great as that without. Bronze natives were
darting here and there. Some were shouting,
some chanting weird witch songs and some dancing
about as if mere action suited the occasion.</p>
<p>The little doctor was nowhere to be seen.
Among them all there was one calm figure&mdash;Curlie
Carson. And he of all things! Johnny
stood and stared in blank astonishment. Curlie
sat cross-legged on the floor blowing on a tin
whistle, or rather several tin whistles, one at a
time. On his knees rested a telephone instrument.
Each time he blew a whistle he inclined
his head toward the receiver of this instrument.
His eyes, for the most part, were fixed on the
broad back of the grotesque, gigantic mechanical
figure who, for the moment at least, blocked the
threatening horde of blacks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A telephone instrument!&rdquo; Johnny said to
himself, as his astonishment grew by leaps and
bounds. &ldquo;There is not a wire strung within
twenty miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought of a radio sending set. But no.
That was impossible. There had not been time
for installing one. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he assured himself,
&ldquo;one does not send a radio S. O. S. by means
of tin whistles. It&rsquo;s a mad place,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;This cave is full of mad people and Curlie
has gone mad with the rest of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as he arrived at this conclusion, it struck
him that there was some connection between the
peep-peeping of those whistles and the actions of
the mechanical giant. Curlie blew the shortest
whistle several times and the giant began a wild,
frenzied dance; a longer whistle and he swung
his arms and cracked his iron knuckles together;
still another and he began snapping his clanking
jaws.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<p>Slowly it dawned upon Johnny that here was
something quite marvelous; well worth watching
to its very end; a battle between the brains of a
boy and the brawn of a black rabble.</p>
<p>At that moment someone touched his arm. He
turned about quite suddenly. It was the little
doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Johnny answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! You made a marvelous trip. We
shan&rsquo;t need it though. I&rsquo;m sorry. He&rsquo;s gone.
It&rsquo;s all for the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence during which
the giant once more blinked his eyes and cracked
his knuckles together. Also from afar, but much
nearer than before, came the rumble and growl
of thunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You win,&rdquo; said the little doctor. &ldquo;I am glad
for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I win?&rdquo; Johnny did not understand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You get the &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo;. Explain later.
That is, unless those rascals win. They are after
Curlie. They were staging a revolution. Curlie
blew up their ship. Good thing. Nothing better
ever happened. We&rsquo;ll stand by him. But what&rsquo;s
there to do? We haven&rsquo;t weapons&mdash;just a few
machetes, that&rsquo;s all. Besides, these bronze people
are no fighters; never were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and was gone.</p>
<p>Mechanically Johnny moved to a place where
he was quite hidden by darkness but where he
could witness the action of the mob without and
the giant within.</p>
<p>The natives were afraid, that was certain;
afraid of this giant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably think he is the ghost of Christophe.
Singing, dancing and drumming to drive him
away. Well, if I&rsquo;m any judge, he won&rsquo;t drive.
But will they grow bolder? That&rsquo;s the question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the while the giant continued to dance and
grimace, swing his arms and crack his knuckles
while the angry mob, thirsting for revenge,
pressed closer, ever closer to their goal.</p>
<p>At last, as Johnny stood there in the shadows
breathless, watching, he saw a short, broad black
man with a full neck and an exceedingly evil
face dart suddenly forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<p>At once Johnny&rsquo;s brain was in a whirl. These
men were superstitious, he knew that. All blacks
are. Would this man dare attack this mysterious
monster?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he dares,&rdquo; he said aloud, &ldquo;we are lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curlie nodded, but at once the sound of his
whistles grew louder, more insistent, and the
antics of the giant more frantic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will not dare,&rdquo; Johnny told himself. Yet
even as he said it, he knew that he was wrong.
What had come over the black man? Had despair
lent him courage? Had he by some chance
come to realize that the thing before him was
made of copper, steel and wood and was no spirit
at all? Be that as it may, as he paused before the
threatening giant, he suddenly drew a revolver
from his belt and emptied its contents into the
giant&rsquo;s broad breast.</p>
<p>The giant&rsquo;s only answer was a redoubling of
his fury. He danced. He cracked his teeth. He
grimaced terribly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>For a few seconds the black leader wavered.
He took one backward step. At his back sounded
the shouts of his men and from far back of that
came a wild crash of thunder. The storm was
all but upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The battle is won,&rdquo; thought Johnny.</p>
<p>But no, with one wild cry the black man leaped
at the giant. With a cutting, rending crash his
machete drove into the very heart of the giant.
At the same instant an iron hand came down upon
his head.</p>
<p>The black man sank to the stone floor, to lie
there motionless. The giant ceased his swinging
and dancing. Only his eyes still burned a steady
green. Bending slowly over he came to rest in
a position that made it appear that his green eyes
were fixed upon the vanquished leader.</p>
<p>With one wild wail the black horde turned to
race madly away into the night and the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fight,&rdquo; said Curlie, coming forward,
&ldquo;was a draw.&rdquo; His voice was husky. &ldquo;They
did one another in. It&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; he said bending
over the still form of the black leader. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t mean to do that. He threw himself into
it. He was a brave, though mistaken man. Had
he lived at another time or espoused another
cause, he might have died a hero.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you, my friend,&rdquo; he touched the mechanical
giant affectionately, &ldquo;you will live to fight
again. In the world there are ever wrongs to
right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said turning to Johnny, &ldquo;is the advantage
of not being human.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does he work?&rdquo; Johnny asked, looking
with great admiration on the stooping giant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Curlie, &ldquo;is a long story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I trust will keep,&rdquo; said a voice behind
him. He turned to find himself looking into the
eyes of the little doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny here has been traveling on foot for
many hours,&rdquo; the doctor said. &ldquo;He will wish to
eat and sleep. I too would like to know a little
concerning this mechanical marvel. But more
important still&mdash;I think you will agree when it
is told&mdash;is something I have to say to you. Your
giant,&rdquo; he turned a twinkling eye on Curlie,
&ldquo;will be safe enough here. The blacks are gone.
My men, I assure you, would not touch him for
anything in the world. They will carry this unfortunate
black man away. Later you may return
to remove the victor in that unusual combat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime,&rdquo; he turned to lead the way,
&ldquo;I suggest a cup of Haitian coffee, over which I
have a tale to relate, the story of the &lsquo;Rope of
Gold&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rope&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little man held up a hand for silence.
Then he lead the way back into the cave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><br />CHAPTER XXIV
<br />THE STORY IS TOLD</h2>
<p>A half hour later the boys found themselves
seated upon cocoanut fiber mats drinking
Haitian coffee, black and bitter, and listening to
one of the strangest stories ever told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Rope of Gold&rsquo;,&rdquo; the little doctor was
saying, &ldquo;was never in the Citadel. When the
black Emperor Christophe found himself paralyzed
beyond hope of recovery, and all but deserted
by his people, he committed suicide. There
were certain members of his household who remained
loyal to him. Among these was the
bearer of the telescope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knowing the hiding place of the &lsquo;Rope of
Gold&rsquo; within the palace and fearing the destruction
of the palace, he called to his aid a handful
of his own hill people and carried it, not to the
Citadel, but to&mdash;&rdquo; he paused to look up at the
ceiling, &ldquo;to this place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</div>
<p>Instantly there came to Johnny&rsquo;s mind a picture
of the golden green snake that hung from
the cave&rsquo;s ceiling. This was not the room but for
all that he seemed to see it dangling there.
&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;is the &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if to verify this conclusion, the doctor went
on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For more than a century that &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo;,
with all its matchless workmanship in green,
white and yellow gold, has hung within the shadows
of this dingy cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, Providence permitting, it will
again see the light of day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His young companions leaned forward, eager
for the rest of the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I heard of your search and its purpose,&rdquo;
his voice went on quietly, &ldquo;to benefit thousands
of the simple and kindly peasants of Haiti,
I thought once more of my duty regarding the
&lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo;. I had known of its whereabouts
for many years, knew, too, that its secret was
loyally kept.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But now the only relative of the bearer of the
Magic Telescope was passing. A few more
months, weeks, perhaps days, and he would be
gone. Who, then, would guard the secret?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I decided that the time had come for putting
the wealth represented by the heirloom of the
past to work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to the dying man and put my plan
before him. I told him of the work you boys and
the old Professor were planning and of your
search. &lsquo;Christophe,&rsquo; I said to him, &lsquo;in his earlier
days had the good of his people at heart. What
could be more fitting than that the &ldquo;Rope of Gold&rdquo;
be sold to some great museum where it will be
faithfully preserved, and that the money thus
obtained be spent in bettering Haitian people?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a very old man,&rdquo; the doctor sighed.
&ldquo;He was long in seeing the light. In fact, when
I sent for you,&rdquo; he nodded toward Johnny, &ldquo;he
had not given his consent. When you went for
the medicine he had not. That is why I did not
wish to go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But to-night, with his dying breath, he gave
his consent. His best friends, his henchmen,
heard and are satisfied. And to-morrow we bear
the &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo; once more into the light of
day and on down to the valley which Christophe
in his youth loved and to a service for the people
whom he might have served better had not greed
gripped at his heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story was over. Yet, for some time the
two boys sat there, motionless, silent. The whole
affair was so strange, so gloriously wonderful
that they could not make it seem true.</p>
<p>The doctor rose and went back into the darkness
that was the cave. Still they sat there a long
time in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; said Johnny huskily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; Curlie echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think,&rdquo; Curlie spoke once more, &ldquo;he
asked nothing for himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does not care for money. He told me all
about that. His is a remarkable story. I&rsquo;ll tell
you about him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</div>
<p>And there while the dancing flames cast grotesque
shadows on the walls of the cave, Johnny
told the doctor&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>In the meantime, far away in the heart of the
jungle, Doris, Dot, and the Marine King had
found shelter from the storm in a deserted cabin.
For some time their attention was focussed upon
the small but rich treasure Dot had brought from
the ruins. After that their thoughts wandered
elsewhere and they talked of many things; perhaps
&ldquo;of shoes-and-ships&mdash;and sealing wax,&mdash;of
cabbages&mdash;and kings.&rdquo; At any rate the time
passed quickly. The storm, though fierce in its
intensity, was brief in duration. Midnight found
them marching along single file over a narrow
path that, lighted by the moon, revealed to all
the beauty and the glory of a tropical land after
a storm.</p>
<p>In due time they came within sight of the
chateau. Standing there, white in the moonlight,
it seemed a land of dreams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the King admiringly, &ldquo;is some
barracks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my home,&rdquo; was Dot&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky girl!&rdquo; The King&rsquo;s compliment was
genuine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I <span class="small">AM</span> lucky,&rdquo; said Dot in a voice that was deep
with emotion. &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t need a thing. And
just for that I am going to give my whole share
of the jewels to a certain king I happen to know
that he may build a school for some of his black
subjects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the King, bending low, &ldquo;will be
equal to a month&rsquo;s leave and passage home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><br />CHAPTER XXV
<br />THE MARCH OF TRIUMPH</h2>
<p>Johnny and Curlie found no time for talk
in the morning. They gulped down cups of
hot, black coffee, then dressed as best they might
for the triumphal procession that was to accompany
them down the mountain. The newly
chosen native chief had decided that the passing
of the &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo; from their midst should be
made a memorable occasion.</p>
<p>Three hundred natives, resplendent in bright
colored skirts and loin cloths, awaited them.
Heading the procession were ten native drummers.
The doctor had given his word that for
this one day no drummer would be molested by
native police or Marines.</p>
<p>Behind the drummers were the ten strongest
natives of the tribe. Superb figures they were,
too! These were to bear on their shoulders the
&lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">[273]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It,&rdquo; said Johnny, striving in vain to control
his emotions, &ldquo;why, it&mdash;it&rsquo;s like some picture
taken from the Bible. The High Priests and
the Ark of the Covenant, you know. Makes a
fellow feel sort of solemn, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Curlie quietly, &ldquo;it does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys took their appointed place behind
the bearers of the golden treasure, then the long
march to Terre Plaisance began.</p>
<p>At the very end of the procession, stumping
stubbornly along under the urge of native
drivers, were Curlie&rsquo;s three donkeys. On their
backs in hampers rode the mysterious mechanical
giant who the night before had fought so
valiant a battle.</p>
<p>So all through that long, hot tropical day they
marched until, just as the sun sank low, they
caught the gleam of white chateau and knew that
their journey was near its end.</p>
<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock that night they were assembled
in the garden of the beautiful old chateau. They
were all there, the entire cast in this little drama
of a strange tropical world. Curlie and Johnny,
Doris, Dot and Dorn were all there dressed in
their best; so, too, was the little doctor and even
Johnny&rsquo;s aged Professor, and the Marine King.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">[274]</div>
<p>The bronze natives had gone back to their cave,
laden with such food as the whites could provide.
Old Pompee, Mona and Nieta hovered in the
background.</p>
<p>At this time all eyes were turned to Curlie,
for, after all, had it not been his mechanical
genius that had saved the &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo;? And
how much did they know concerning that unusual
mechanical giant who had saved the day
for them? Little enough, I assure you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Curlie, hesitatingly, &ldquo;there really
isn&rsquo;t much that I can tell. I got the idea first
from a thing I saw in Chicago. The advertisement
said that a mechanical man would wash
clothes, sweep the floor, light the lamps and all
that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">[275]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The man I found there was a joke. He had
legs and arms of sheet steel. His face was
painted on steel. He couldn&rsquo;t move a muscle, so
to speak. But the things the operator did interested
me. Simply by blowing whistles of different
pitch into a telephone he could make his
mechanical man start and stop a washing machine,
a vacuum sweeper, and a lot of other
electrical appliances. Then, one day in New
York, while I was waiting for the boat to sail
for Haiti, I came upon old Mike himself. Some
foreign fellow had brought him over from Europe.
Hoped to make a lot of money with him in
vaudeville. The thing had been a flop. The fellow
was broke. I had some money I had made
on rubber in South America, so I bought old
Mike and brought him along. Glad I did.
Thought he would be a lot of fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was more than that,&rdquo; said Johnny quietly.
&ldquo;He saved our lives, without a doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried substituting drums for whistles,&rdquo;
Curlie went on, &ldquo;but it wouldn&rsquo;t work. Remember
when you and Pompee saw the ghost of the
black king and his telescope bearer walking on
the wall?&rdquo; he asked turning to Dorn.</p>
<p>Dorn nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was Mike and yours truly. I was trying
him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Doris, &ldquo;explains the donkey
tracks we saw up there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">[276]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. And you can&rsquo;t imagine what a
time I had getting the donkeys to carry all that
load up those steps,&rdquo; Curlie laughed. &ldquo;But I
did it. And Mike did his bit, wonderfully well
even then. Mike is a marvel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have seen him perform,&rdquo; he said turning
to Johnny, &ldquo;but these other people,&rdquo; he reached
for a telephone receiver at his side, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t had
the pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he blew a shrill note into the telephone.
At once there sounded from a dark
corner the clank-clank of metal striking on
stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said Doris, leaning eagerly forward.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming, the man of iron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. The giant towered before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pluto really did him very little harm,&rdquo; said
Curlie. &ldquo;His machete severed two wires, that&rsquo;s
all. There&rsquo;s a lot to him. Part is telephone
switchboard equipment. Radio, of course, enters
in and all sorts of wheels. But all and all he&rsquo;s
rather complete.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, I blow again into the receiver. This
whistle is of a lower pitch. Now he begins to
blink his eyes. And now,&rdquo; again a whistle, &ldquo;he
waves his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He bows, he cracks his teeth, he strikes out.
In fact,&rdquo; he said finally, &ldquo;there is nothing he cannot
do, providing one works out the mechanical
appliances for making him do it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; he said with a note of regret,
&ldquo;that I couldn&rsquo;t supply him with a set of brains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Mike had furnished his share of the
evening&rsquo;s entertainment and had frightened the
black servants out of a year&rsquo;s growth in the bargain,
he was marched back to his place in a dark
corner and it was time to talk of other things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow the &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo; sails for
America,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Professor. &ldquo;I was able to get
in touch with the <i>Torentia</i>. She will touch at
Cape Haitian. That saves you a tiresome journey
to Port au Prince and insures the &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo;
a safe passage to America.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">[278]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And to-morrow,&rdquo; he added, a note of great
gladness creeping into his tone, &ldquo;we begin the
task of building up the waste places. In due
time the old French aqueduct will be the new
American one and thousands will benefit by the
pluck and daring of two American boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two boys and one giant,&rdquo; laughed Johnny.</p>
<p>Late the next afternoon a boy and a girl stood
on the deck of the <i>Torentia</i>, bound for America.
The shoreline of Haiti was fast fading from
their sight. America loomed far ahead. Already
they were dreaming. Doris was seeing
red, yellow, orange, pink and blue dresses without
number. Johnny was dreaming of other far
lands and strange adventures.</p>
<p>As for Curlie and Dot, who remained behind,
they were seated beneath a great, wind-twisted
cocoanut tree watching the ship grow small in
the distance. Did they too dream? Beyond
doubt they did; for Haiti is the land of sunlight
and dreams.</p>
<p>So ends the story of the &lsquo;Rope of Gold&rsquo;.
Johnny Thompson&rsquo;s wanderings were not yet
over, as you will see if you find time to read our
next book, entitled, &ldquo;The Arrow of Fire.&rdquo;</p>
